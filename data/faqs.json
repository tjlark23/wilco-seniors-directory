      "question": "How much does in-home care cost in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "In-home care in Williamson County typically costs between $25 and $35 per hour for non-medical personal care, with skilled nursing visits running higher depending on the level of care required. Rates vary by agency, the type of services needed, and whether you need daytime, overnight, or weekend coverage. Many agencies offer free in-home assessments to provide an accurate quote based on your specific situation."

      "question": "Does Medicare cover in-home care services?",
      "answer": "Medicare covers skilled home health services such as nursing care, physical therapy, and occupational therapy when ordered by a physician and provided by a Medicare-certified agency. However, Medicare does not typically cover long-term personal care like bathing assistance, meal preparation, or companionship. Medicaid, veterans' benefits, and long-term care insurance may help cover these non-medical services for qualifying individuals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I choose a reputable in-home care agency in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "Start by verifying that the agency is licensed by Texas Health and Human Services. Ask about their caregiver screening process, including background checks and training requirements. Request references from families in your area, and check online reviews. A reputable agency will offer a free assessment, provide a clear service agreement, and have a plan for backup coverage if your regular caregiver is unavailable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I hire a private caregiver instead of going through an agency?",
      "answer": "You can hire a private caregiver directly, which is sometimes less expensive, but it comes with added responsibilities. As the employer, you would be responsible for payroll taxes, workers' compensation insurance, and liability if the caregiver is injured in your home. Agencies handle all of these obligations and also provide supervision, backup staff, and a structured vetting process. Many families find the peace of mind from an agency is worth the additional cost."

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between memory care and assisted living?",
      "answer": "Memory care is a specialized form of assisted living designed specifically for residents with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other cognitive impairments. Memory care communities offer secured environments to prevent wandering, higher staff-to-resident ratios, and programming tailored to cognitive stimulation. Assisted living communities serve a broader population and may not have the specialized training or security features that memory care provides."

      "question": "How much does memory care cost in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "Memory care in Williamson County generally ranges from $4,500 to $7,500 per month, depending on the community, the level of care required, and the type of room.

It is important to ask exactly what is included in the monthly fee and what triggers additional charges."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is it time to consider memory care for a loved one?",
      "answer": "Signs that it may be time to explore memory care include wandering or getting lost in familiar places, difficulty managing medications safely, increased confusion about time and place, safety concerns like leaving the stove on, and caregiver burnout in the family. A geriatrician or neurologist can help assess the level of cognitive decline and provide guidance on appropriate care settings."

      "question": "Does Medicaid cover memory care in Texas?",
      "answer": "Texas Medicaid does not directly pay for memory care community room and board, but the STAR+PLUS Medicaid waiver program can cover some care services for qualifying individuals in assisted living and memory care settings. Eligibility is based on both financial criteria and the level of care needed. An elder law attorney or Medicaid planning specialist in Williamson County can help you understand your options and structure finances to qualify."

When comparing costs, ask what is included in the base rate and what services, such as medication management or incontinence care, may result in additional charges."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I look for when touring a senior living community?",
      "answer": "Visit during mealtime to observe the dining experience and social atmosphere. Watch how staff interact with residents and note whether they are attentive and friendly. Ask about staff turnover rates, which can indicate employee satisfaction and care consistency. Inquire about activity calendars, transportation, healthcare coordination, and what happens if your care needs change over time. Talk to current residents and their families if possible."
    },

      "question": "Is Sun City Texas only for people 55 and older?",
      "answer": "Sun City Texas is an age-restricted community that requires at least one person in each household to be 55 or older.

      "question": "What is the difference between a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit and a regular check-up?",
      "answer": "The Annual Wellness Visit, covered by Medicare at no cost to you, is a preventive visit focused on creating or updating a personalized health plan. It includes a health risk assessment, review of medications, screening schedule recommendations, and advance care planning. It is not a head-to-toe physical exam. If your doctor addresses a specific health concern during the wellness visit, that portion may be billed separately under Medicare Part B."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I choose a geriatrician or a regular primary care doctor?",
      "answer": "Geriatricians are internists or family physicians with additional training in the medical needs of older adults, including managing multiple chronic conditions, medication interactions, and cognitive changes. If you are relatively healthy and active, a general primary care physician experienced with 55+ patients may be an excellent fit. If you have complex health issues or take many medications, a geriatrician may be particularly valuable. Williamson County has both options available."
    },
    {
      "question": "What preventive screenings should seniors get regularly?",
      "answer": "Recommended screenings for adults 55 and older include annual wellness visits covered by Medicare, blood pressure monitoring, cholesterol testing, diabetes screening, colorectal cancer screening, bone density tests for osteoporosis, vision and hearing exams, and cancer screenings appropriate for your age and risk factors. Your primary care physician can create a personalized preventive care schedule based on your health history and family background."

  "physical-therapy": [
    {
      "question": "How many physical therapy sessions does Medicare cover?",
      "answer": "Medicare does not set a hard limit on the number of physical therapy visits. Coverage is based on medical necessity, meaning your therapist and physician must document that the therapy is reasonable and necessary for your condition. Your therapist will set goals and track progress, and Medicare will continue to cover sessions as long as you are making documented improvement. There is an annual spending threshold that may trigger a review, but it is not a hard cap."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a doctor's referral for physical therapy in Texas?",
      "answer": "Texas allows direct access to physical therapy, meaning you can begin treatment without a physician referral. However, Medicare requires a physician's order for covered PT services. If you plan to use Medicare, ask your doctor for a referral. For other insurance plans, check your policy or call your insurer to confirm whether a referral is needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I expect at my first physical therapy appointment?",
      "answer": "Your first visit is typically an evaluation lasting 45 minutes to an hour. The therapist will review your medical history, assess your strength, flexibility, balance, and range of motion, and discuss your goals. They will develop a treatment plan outlining how often you should attend, what exercises you will do, and what milestones they expect you to reach. Wear comfortable clothing and bring a list of your medications and any relevant imaging or surgical reports."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is in-home physical therapy available in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "Yes, several home health agencies in Williamson County provide in-home physical therapy for seniors who have difficulty traveling to a clinic. In-home PT is often appropriate after a hospital stay or surgery, or for individuals with significant mobility limitations. Medicare covers home-based PT when you are considered homebound, meaning leaving home requires considerable effort. Your doctor can order home health PT as part of your recovery plan."

      "question": "Does Medicare cover hearing aids?",
      "answer": "Original Medicare Parts A and B does not cover hearing aids or hearing aid fitting exams. However, many Medicare Advantage plans include some level of hearing aid benefit, ranging from a discount to a fixed dollar allowance toward the purchase of hearing aids. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, check your plan's Summary of Benefits or call the plan directly to understand your coverage. Some Williamson County audiologists also offer financing plans and bundled pricing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should seniors have their eyes checked?",
      "answer": "The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults 65 and older have a comprehensive dilated eye exam every one to two years, even if they have no symptoms. Medicare covers an annual dilated eye exam for people at high risk for glaucoma, and those with diabetes are eligible for an annual diabetic eye exam. Early detection of conditions like macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataracts can preserve your vision and prevent more serious problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the signs of age-related hearing loss?",
      "answer": "Common signs include difficulty following conversations in noisy environments, frequently asking people to repeat themselves, turning up the television or phone volume, feeling like others are mumbling, and withdrawing from social situations because of communication difficulties. If you or your family notice these patterns, schedule a hearing evaluation with an audiologist. Hearing loss often develops gradually, and early intervention with hearing aids leads to better outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are over-the-counter hearing aids a good option for seniors?",
      "answer": "Over-the-counter hearing aids, available since 2022, can be a more affordable option for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. They do not require a prescription or professional fitting and typically cost between $200 and $1,000 per pair. However, they are not suitable for severe hearing loss and do not include the personalized programming that a professionally fitted device provides. An audiologist can help you determine whether OTC or prescription hearing aids are the better choice for your level of hearing loss."

    {
      "question": "Does Medicare cover dental care?",
      "answer": "Original Medicare Parts A and B does not cover most routine dental care, including cleanings, fillings, dentures, or extractions. Medicare Part A may cover dental services that are an integral part of a hospital procedure, such as jaw reconstruction after an accident. Many Medicare Advantage plans include some dental coverage, and standalone dental discount plans and dental insurance are available for purchase. Ask your dentist about senior pricing and payment plans as well."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should seniors visit the dentist?",
      "answer": "Most dentists recommend that seniors visit twice a year for cleanings and exams, though some individuals with gum disease or other oral health issues may need more frequent visits. Regular dental visits are important for detecting oral cancer, monitoring gum health, adjusting dentures, and addressing dry mouth caused by medications. Preventive care is far less expensive and less invasive than treating problems that have been allowed to progress."
    },
    {
      "question": "What dental options are available for seniors on a fixed income in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "Several options can make dental care more affordable. Lone Star Circle of Care operates community health centers in the area with sliding-scale dental fees based on income. Dental schools in the Austin area offer reduced-cost care provided by supervised students. Some Williamson County dentists offer senior discounts, payment plans, or participate in dental discount programs. Additionally, Medicare Advantage plans with dental benefits can significantly reduce out-of-pocket costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes dry mouth in seniors and how does it affect dental health?",
      "answer": "Dry mouth is most commonly caused by medications, including blood pressure drugs, antidepressants, antihistamines, and diuretics. Reduced saliva increases the risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and oral infections because saliva helps wash away food particles and neutralize acids. If you experience persistent dry mouth, talk to your dentist about saliva substitutes, sugar-free lozenges, and fluoride rinses that can help protect your teeth."

      "question": "Does Medicare cover mental health services?",
      "answer": "Yes, Medicare Part B covers outpatient mental health services including individual and group therapy sessions with licensed psychologists, clinical social workers, and psychiatrists.

The Area Agency on Aging of the Capital Area offers caregiver support groups and respite care referrals. Bluebonnet Trails Community Services provides sliding-scale counseling. The Alzheimer's Association hosts local caregiver support groups in Georgetown and Round Rock. Many therapists in the area specialize in caregiver stress and understand the unique emotional challenges involved."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I tell if an older adult is experiencing depression versus normal aging?",
      "answer": "While some changes in energy and activity levels are a normal part of aging, persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness, and social withdrawal are signs of clinical depression that deserve professional attention. Depression is not a normal part of aging, and it is highly treatable. If you are concerned about yourself or a loved one, talk to a primary care physician or mental health professional."

      "question": "Are telehealth therapy sessions available for seniors in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "Yes, many therapists and counselors in Williamson County offer telehealth appointments via video or phone call.

    {
      "question": "How can I save money on prescriptions in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "Several strategies can reduce prescription costs. Ask your pharmacist about generic alternatives, which are often significantly cheaper than brand-name drugs. Use the Medicare Plan Finder to compare Part D plans during open enrollment and choose one that covers your specific medications. Many pharmacies offer price-matching and discount programs, and H-E-B Pharmacy has a well-known low-cost generic program. GoodRx and similar discount cards can sometimes beat insurance copays for certain medications."

Some offer free delivery for regular customers, while others charge a small fee. Mail-order pharmacy through your Medicare Part D plan is another option for medications you take regularly, often with a 90-day supply at a reduced copay. Ask your pharmacy about their specific delivery options and any minimum order requirements."

      "question": "What is medication therapy management and is it covered by Medicare?",
      "answer": "Medication therapy management is a service where a pharmacist reviews all of your medications, identifies potential interactions or duplications, and works with your doctors to optimize your drug regimen. Medicare Part D plans are required to offer MTM at no additional cost to qualifying beneficiaries, typically those who take multiple medications for chronic conditions. This service can catch problems before they cause harm and may reduce your overall medication costs."

    {
      "question": "When is it appropriate to consider hospice care?",
      "answer": "Hospice care is appropriate when a physician determines that a patient has a life expectancy of six months or less if the illness runs its normal course, and the patient or family chooses to focus on comfort rather than curative treatment. Many families wait too long to contact hospice, and earlier enrollment allows patients and families to benefit fully from the comprehensive support services hospice provides. You can always revoke hospice and return to curative treatment if your condition improves."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does hospice care cost?",
      "answer": "For most seniors, hospice care is covered by Medicare with little to no out-of-pocket cost. The Medicare Hospice Benefit covers nursing visits, medications related to the terminal diagnosis, medical equipment like hospital beds and oxygen, social worker and chaplain services, home health aide visits, and short-term respite care. Medicaid and most private insurance plans also cover hospice. There may be small copays for respite care and outpatient prescriptions."

  "estate-planning": [
    {
      "question": "What documents should be included in a basic estate plan?",
      "answer": "A comprehensive estate plan for Texas seniors typically includes a last will and testament, a durable power of attorney for financial matters, a medical power of attorney, a directive to physicians (living will), and a HIPAA authorization. Depending on your assets and goals, your attorney may also recommend a revocable living trust to avoid probate, beneficiary designations review, and a letter of instruction with personal wishes and account information for your family."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does estate planning cost in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "A basic estate plan including a will, powers of attorney, and directive to physicians typically costs between $1,000 and $2,500 in Williamson County, depending on the attorney and the complexity of your situation. Plans that include trusts generally range from $2,500 to $5,000 or more. Many attorneys offer flat-fee pricing so you know the total cost upfront.

Texas law may also change in ways that affect your plan. Keeping your documents current ensures your wishes are accurately reflected and your family is not left dealing with outdated instructions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a trust or is a will sufficient in Texas?",
      "answer": "For many Texas seniors with straightforward situations, a well-drafted will combined with beneficiary designations on accounts achieves the same goals as a trust at lower cost. Texas has a relatively streamlined probate process compared to many states. A trust is particularly valuable if you own property in multiple states, have a blended family, want to set conditions on distributions, or want to keep your financial affairs private. An experienced estate planning attorney can help you determine the right approach."

    {
      "question": "What is a fiduciary financial advisor and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "A fiduciary financial advisor is legally required to act in your best interest at all times, recommending investments and strategies that benefit you rather than generating commissions for themselves. Not all financial advisors are fiduciaries. Asking this question upfront is one of the most important steps you can take when choosing an advisor. Fee-only advisors, who are compensated solely by client fees rather than product commissions, are always fiduciaries."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do financial advisors charge in Williamson County?",
      "answer": "Fee structures vary. Fee-only advisors typically charge a percentage of assets under management, usually around 0.75 to 1.25 percent annually, or a flat annual fee ranging from $2,000 to $7,500 depending on the complexity of your financial situation. Some advisors offer hourly consulting at $150 to $350 per hour for specific questions rather than ongoing management. Commission-based advisors earn money from product sales, which is free to you upfront but may involve higher-cost products."

      "question": "When should I start working with a financial advisor for retirement?",
      "answer": "Ideally, you should consult a financial advisor several years before your planned retirement date to ensure your savings, investment allocation, and income strategy are on track. However, it is never too late to get professional advice. Many Williamson County seniors seek an advisor after retiring to help manage required minimum distributions, Social Security optimization, tax-efficient withdrawals, and long-term care planning. Even a single planning session can provide valuable clarity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What questions should I ask a financial advisor before hiring them?",
      "answer": "Key questions include: Are you a fiduciary? How are you compensated? What is your experience working with retirees? How often will we meet to review my plan? What is your investment philosophy, especially regarding risk management for retirees? Can you provide references from clients in a similar financial situation? Do you coordinate with estate planning attorneys and CPAs? Understanding these answers will help you find an advisor who is the right fit for your needs."

You can add a Medigap supplement to reduce out-of-pocket costs and a Part D plan for prescriptions. Medicare Advantage (Part C) bundles everything into one plan, often including dental, vision, hearing, and prescription coverage, but typically requires you to use a network of providers.

      "question": "How does Medicaid planning work in Texas?",
      "answer": "Medicaid planning involves structuring a senior's assets and income to qualify for Medicaid coverage of long-term care while preserving as much wealth as possible for the healthy spouse and family. Texas has specific rules about exempt assets, income caps, lookback periods of five years, and spousal protections. An elder law attorney can advise on legal strategies such as Medicaid-compliant annuities, irrevocable trusts, and spend-down approaches that comply with Texas law."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would my family need to pursue guardianship?",
      "answer": "Guardianship may be necessary when a senior can no longer make safe decisions about their health, finances, or daily life and does not have valid powers of attorney in place. A court appoints a guardian to make decisions on behalf of the incapacitated person. It is a formal legal process that requires medical evidence and a court hearing. Having powers of attorney in place before they are needed can often avoid the need for guardianship entirely, which is why advance planning is so important."

If your combined income exceeds $25,000 for a single filer or $32,000 for a married couple filing jointly, a portion of your benefits may be taxable. Up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits can be subject to federal income tax. Texas does not have a state income tax, so your benefits are not taxed at the state level."

  "reverse-mortgage": [
    {
      "question": "How does a reverse mortgage work?",
      "answer": "A reverse mortgage allows homeowners age 62 and older to convert a portion of their home equity into cash without selling their home or making monthly mortgage payments. The loan is repaid when the borrower sells the home, moves out permanently, or passes away. You can receive funds as a lump sum, monthly payments, a line of credit, or a combination. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance, so the loan amount grows over time while your remaining home equity decreases."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the risks of a reverse mortgage?",
      "answer": "Key risks include the loan balance growing over time as interest accrues, which reduces the equity available to your heirs. You must continue to pay property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and maintenance costs, or the loan can become due immediately. If you need to move to a care facility and are away from the home for more than 12 consecutive months, the loan becomes due. A reverse mortgage is not free money; it is a loan against your home that must eventually be repaid."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is HUD counseling required before getting a reverse mortgage?",
      "answer": "Yes, HUD requires all applicants for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, the most common type of reverse mortgage, to complete counseling with an independent HUD-approved counseling agency before applying. The counseling session covers how reverse mortgages work, alternatives to consider, the financial implications for you and your heirs, and your obligations as a borrower. This requirement protects consumers from entering into a reverse mortgage without fully understanding the commitment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can my heirs keep the home after I pass away?",
      "answer": "Yes, your heirs have the option to keep the home by paying off the reverse mortgage balance, either through refinancing into a traditional mortgage or using other funds. If the home is worth more than the loan balance, your heirs keep the difference. If the loan balance exceeds the home's value, heirs can walk away without owing the difference because reverse mortgages are non-recourse loans. Heirs typically have 30 days after notification to decide and up to six months to complete the sale or payoff, with possible extensions."

    },
    {
      "question": "Is pickleball safe for seniors with joint issues?",
      "answer": "Pickleball is generally considered a low-impact sport that is much easier on joints than tennis. The smaller court means less running, the paddle is lighter than a tennis racket, and the plastic ball travels more slowly. However, like any physical activity, there is some risk of injury, particularly from quick lateral movements. Warming up properly, wearing supportive court shoes, and playing at a pace comfortable for your fitness level can minimize risk. Consult your doctor if you have specific joint or balance concerns."

Local sporting goods stores in Round Rock and Georgetown carry a selection of paddles at various price points, and staff can help you choose based on your grip size and playing style."
