        "text": "I'm so happy for all those that got wonderful service. Our experience wasn't that great at all. Where to begin. The caregiver they sent wasn't all there and had no experience at all with what mom needed. I was told at the start when the nurse came that the reason she comes is to ensure its a good match. I was very clear with the level of care mom needed and what it took. The caregiver did what she wanted to do. I asked her to do a bath. I come back in 45 mins and she hadn't fed my mom or anything, she was still trying to put the brief on...45 min. I'm like why didn't you come get me and why didn't you give her a bath? The caregiver says, I figured you could have hospice do it. 45 mins, no food or anything and I had to put the brief on. She left dirty wipes on moms table, left 2 packs of wipes open that dried out. The caregiver nails were super long and scratched my mom up. When I notified the company, the response was, she just got back from vacation. Not sorry, is she okay, nothing. Are agreement was 7 days a week. On Friday, I was like I'll see you tomorrow. She said, nope, I don't do weekends. I had to cancel my plans. I told them I didn't want her back. The caregiver comes twice without my permission. You used the code when we weren't home to let herself in! Anyway, we go without care of course. I give them another chance, some other girl shows up, and says to a friend of mine, are you the girl I'm training, I sent her right home. She didn't even see or touch mom? like what?? None of this was told to me at all. That two girls were coming, they were training or anything. I give them a 3rd chance saying mom will be home Monday, we can pick up then, she goes let me know.  I'm confused because I literally said Monday. I just let you know. Here's the kicker, are agreement was 1 hour visits. They knew the caregiver knew. When it got close to an hour I reminded the caregiver. She would sit there and argue with me about leaving. Then she tells me, she clocks out at an hour and just stays, she does it all the time. I few times, I couldn't get this girl to leave. She's like I don't want to leave without finishing and I'm like your time is up and you've completed your hour. She even tired to get back up by asking another person in my home am I always like this? I told her there's one queen of this home and that's me! It was horrible. The bill I got was insane. I tried talking to them and nothing. To add, I made them aware, before they started that we have cameras that record, movement, audio and visual and yet, I'm dealing with craziness. And if they respond that any of this is a lie, I will post the text messages!",

This was the only company who could help me on short notice and eased my burden. We had a multitude of caregivers since we were working to provide 24 hour a day coverage over a long weekend, but every single one I worked with -- and I worked with them all -- were compasionate and cared not only for my ailing father, but for my emotional well being as well. Haydee spend multiple days with in and not only cared for my dad with dignity, she did everything she could to make our lives better. Ana come on shift as the hospice nurse was there trying to make dad more confortable and she jumped in. I honestly believed she cared about dad and she certainly watched over him. I can not say enough good things about the company. Every time we had a new caregiver, they were introduced by the owner and she explained what needed to happen and gave clear expectations for dad's care.

I was impressed, the social worker for this area was wonderful with my client’s husband, who was grieving in his own way. Sherrie Lynn McBurney who is the Account Executive was very caring, supportive with my client’s husband  who suffered with Parkinson’s end of life. I thank God they came in to help at this time.

Tragically my dad had two strokes following the surgery, and we ended up needing hospice care services.\n\nWe interviewed a couple of other Hospice companies along with Blue Water, and the other companies made us feel like they were giving us a sales pitch.  Jennifer with Blue Water Hospice made us feel like she really cared to get to know us as we \"interviewed\" her.\n\nWe have zero regrets with going with Blue Water.  When we panicked after getting home and realizing we needed more home health than we anticipated, within hours Denise was out to get 24/7 home health set up.  Denise and the aides were all loving and caring of my dad, as well as the rest of the family.\n\nJennifer, the owner of Blue Water, also provided hospice nursing care for my dad, and she was AMAZING.  She is most definitely doing what God put her on Earth to do, and we are so thankful for the service she provides to our community, and the love both she and her company showed to our family in this very stressful and sad time of our lives.\n\nAll the hospice nurses, the staff at the office, the social worker and minister were all so wonderful.  We felt loved and my dad was very cared for until the very end.\n\nNo one every wants to go through something like this, but if you need extra help after a surgery or to help an elderly family member, or if you sadly, need hospice, I cannot recommend Blue Water enough.  I would give more than 5 stars if I could!\n\nThank you Jennifer and Company!  We are grateful for you!",

I have to say, Stephanie and her team are very courteous, kind, compassionate, professional, and really care about their client as if it were their own loved one. We needed a couple of shifts for our loved one, and the team worked with us to find the best caregiver for him, and were able to accommodate our weird shift schedule. I have recommended Stephanie's team to several people that I have met who have inquired about searching for caregivers, and I will continue to refer/recommend Abundance Home Care to anyone who is needing a caregiver. I was very impressed with their mission statement, and the type of care provided aligns across the board with their mission and values. Our loved one was very happy with the caregivers that were assigned by Abundance Home Care, and we were always in the loop about the care because there was a daily log that was kept of the routine and everything that went on with the care. I would highly recommend setting an appointment with them and getting to know Stephanie and how she can help you provide the best care for your loved one.",

Home Instead quickly understood our needs and accommodated us immediately. Our lives were changing daily as my father began his transition and the Home Instead scheduler was able to flawlessly flow with those changes.\nNow that my father has passed, and my mother will be living with me, she is still wanting the security of having her caregiver with her while my husband and I work during the day. Thank you so much to everyone at Home Instead for all your support to my family during this VERY difficult and sometimes stressful time.",

After trying other agencies I found Right at Home through another highly recommended agency that was short on staff due to Covid.  That is a the highest compliment when another company is comfortable referring potential clients to you.  Thank goodness they were short handed because it was Kismet that we found Right at Home.  First let me say, if you feel the people you are using fall short of your expectations you are probably right and you should call Onika with Right at Home.  I felt guilty about firing other companies but turns out I was right in thinking they weren't what we should be getting for our money.  Right at Home will find the perfect fit for you and make sure that things are professional, respectful and enjoyable!  They also came through in a pinch when my husbands job pushed into the same time I was scheduled to fly home and close out moms house.  We could not leave her a alone nor could I take her back with me.  They found staff to fill in every minute we needed someone here to care for mom.  That gave me such peace of mind in an already tumultuous situation.  Thank you to these amazing people!!",

I have become very familiar with them and their routines. I try to make them feel seen and heard addressing any concerns they may have, plus they also look forward to me coming, if I'm early they pay attention to the small details and will be like you are early today lol or the questions of will you be coming back tomorrow. What I most enjoy is being able to help them and talk with them asking them how they day has been, sharing my time with them really warms my heart and I look forward to being able to do this for many more day, months, even years to come.",

        "text": "Dr.A was a life saver! My elderly father was located in Round Rock and I live in Arizona and was not able to fly out right away to help take care of him when he needed assistance. I was referred to ComforCare and was a little nervous at first, but from the first phone call they made me feel comfortable and safe to help provide care for my father. They reassured me they were able to provide the services he needed and were very thorough with providing me the information I needed to stay calm in this hard time. I was not aware of how bad his condition was since he kept telling me he was fine. Dr.A and her team came in our lives at the perfect time to help until I arrived in Texas. They provided 24 hour care before he went to the rehab center to get his strength back before moving him to Arizona. My father said they were lovely and didn’t want to stop the services because he enjoyed everyone who took care of him. Which he doesn’t say about people who help him since he doesn’t feel like he needs help. If I was not moving him to Arizona we would still be using their services! I am truly blessed for Dr.A stepping in and informing me he needed more care than I thought he did. She did not do it in a way where she was trying to make more money for the company, she did it in a caring way saying this is what I would want my loved one to have in this situation. She treated him like he was a loved one and helped guide me to make the decisions I needed to make and calm my nerves as well. She also referred him to a nurse to get all of his medications together. They assessed he was not properly taking his medications so she had the nurse there first thing. I was able to call Dr.A and ask any questions and her right hand woman Nicole was amazing and so kind as well! This company truly made me feel safe, informed and cared for when I was in another state very nervous. Thank you Dr.A for being the angel you are and taking part of saving my dads life.",

From the hospital to skilled nursing and rehab facilities, we kept being promised improvement — yet every single time, he declined. Twice, he came within hours of losing his life. We were terrified of placing him anywhere again, yet I didn’t think keeping him home was even possible.\n\nAnd then we found AMADA.\n\nFrom the very first moment, the difference was undeniable. Within minutes of submitting an online inquiry, the owner himself, Patrick, reached out. That same day, Patrick and Magnolia showed up at our home — compassionate, knowledgeable, and determined to help us find a real solution. Their office manager, Ama, handled everything with lightning speed and genuine care. She even helped us get approved for a program that covered several visits at no cost.\n\nBecause of AMADA’s efficiency, compassion, and true dedication to families like ours, we were able to start services the very next morning.\n\nFor the first time in months, we felt hope.\n\nAMADA didn’t just provide caregivers — they gave my brother back his dignity, safety, and comfort. He is now able to stay at home, where he is happiest and belongs… and that peace of mind is priceless.\n\nIf you are overwhelmed, scared, or unsure where to turn for a loved one’s care, please learn from our experience: AMADA is the company you want on your side. Their team is extraordinary, and their level of compassion and responsiveness is something I’ve never seen in this industry.\n\nI will recommend AMADA to absolutely everyone. They changed our lives — and I am forever grateful.",

I sent a text as soon as we were back. No response. I then get a text saying visit was cancelled and asked me to take another day off work. Which I'm sure would be a no show as well. Very unprofessional and definitely not invested in caring for your loved one.",

From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with such genuine warmth by staff. It’s clear that the staff here truly care about the residents and their families.\n\nAbi truly stood out and left an incredible impression on both of us. From the very first moment we met her, it was clear she is someone special. She radiates warmth and passion for what she does. We had the pleasure of being invited to watch a fitness activity, and she went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed.\n\nBefore the class, Abi noticed a subtle shift in a resident’s mood and quietly checked in with  the resident privately. It was a small, thoughtful moment that reflects how staff pay attention to individual needs and personalize each resident’s daily experience, even when no one is watching.\n\nThroughout the class, that same personal connection continued to shine through. Abi’s ability to motivate through kindness was remarkable; always leading with positive reinforcement before offering gentle corrections, ensuring everyone felt supported and capable every step of the way.\n\nIt brought such warmth to our hearts knowing that our friends have found a community like Grand Living, one that not only provides exceptional care but fosters belonging, purpose, and connection. Abi, along with the rest of the Grand Living team, exemplifies everything you would hope to find in a community like this.\n\nTo Abi and the rest of the Grand Living team, thank you for what you do!",

It's a clean, well maintained,  stationary resort that i recommend you visit weather looking for a home, or a job.  Just the essence is awesome and life changing.",

The facility is beautifully maintained—clean, bright, and thoughtfully designed with the comfort and dignity of its residents in mind. The attention to detail in both the living spaces and common areas reflects a genuine respect for the elderly community they serve.\n\nThe staff stood out as the heart of Grand Living. Everyone I encountered was not only courteous but also compassionate, patient, and attentive. It was clear that they are committed to creating a safe, supportive, and enriching environment for the residents.\n\nDuring my tour, I observed several residents engaged in activities—from music sessions to peaceful reading corners—which suggests a healthy focus on mental, emotional, and social wellness. The dining area was also impressive, offering a restaurant-style experience that promotes both nutrition and connection.\n\nWhat truly made an impression was the sense of community. Grand Living doesn’t just provide care—it fosters a sense of home, purpose, and belonging.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Grand Living to anyone seeking a high-quality assisted living facility. It’s a place where elders are treated with honor, kindness, and genuine care.",

As we searched for similar similar living solutions, which prioritized friendly staff,  great food, activities, amenities, value, and thoughtful solutions along an with aging pathway for any future care, we found one clear winner in every category.   Two months later I have no doubt Grand Living - Georgetown delivers the best experience, and separately value, available when compared any other option in the area.  From the initial meeting, to watching how the team very successfully handled a city-wide (Georgetown) power outage, a concerned resident trying to reach an external doctor, to regularly viewing the whole team's approach to all situations, I have been nothing short of impressed and grateful.   I'd add an extra bit thanks to Cole Taylor, who handles their building and facilities.   His professionalism in multiple areas and ability to handle everything from  emergencies to guest and resident services or adapt to any  request is simply next level.       People here seem to have a kind attitude overall while enjoying life and caring for seniors.  In 25-30 years, I can absolutely see my wife and I living happily in a place like this.  The regular live music is outstanding too.",

        "text": "I hope my review helps guide you in finding the very best memory care / senior living home for your loved one. After 2 long weeks of touring multiple memory care locations in the Georgetown and the surrounding area, we chose the Delaney and here’s why.\n\nFirst, my high school classmate from 1987 actually worked for The Delaney for 8 years so I had some good inside information as to why it’s ranked as the best facility in the area. She ended up putting own her mom there so that in itself gave me even more confidence in what can be one of the hardest decisions you will make in your life.\n\nOur parents raised us and took care of us the best they could so now it was my time to give back and find my mom the best place to now call home. It is a very clean place and homey environment atmosphere.\n\nSo the results are in; after 2 months and 14 days.  I absolutely made the right decision for my mom. Shannan the memory care director has a wonderful dedicated loving team who will be completely focused and care for your loved one in every way possible. Shannan is just one call away from allowing me to check on my mom when I’m out of town. She’s has even taken my calls on her day off. This is an example of the high level of service and response the Delaney gives their residents and the families.\n\nThey make her bed everyday, they help her shower, they help her in the bathroom and even the cleaning staff (Tiffany) who keeps the place extremely clean loves and cares for my mom. They have med techs whose sole purpose is to administer medications on time, every time. They have nurses on site 24 hours a day and I’m one text away from requesting anything my mom may need or want.\nThey are also a class B facility which is very important to know. Just so many care givers dedicated to your loved ones needs.\n\nIt’s always enjoyable to visit my mom and take her to lunch or dinner in the many dining rooms they have. The food is amazing and they have 2 executive chef’s preparing some really great dishes. I would also point out that I have met the director of maintenance which is responsible for keeping the place so clean and everything working and they do a fine job. They even have a wonderful activity director coordinating environment and fun for the residents.\n\nGo visit the Delaney and ask to meet the directors and you will understand how they have earned my perfect review.\n\nRemember, you are doing what you have to do in a tough situation and knowing your loved one is safe and cared for so well will bring you comfort and peace of mind. If your loved one can’t be home anymore, this is the next best place to call home.\n\nBlessings on your journey.\n\nDerek",

The activities are amazing and the staff is very welcoming and loving.  Mom says living at the Delaney is living being on a cruise but without the water.  If you have a loved one that needs more attention than they can get living at home, consider the Delaney.  Mom spent many years as an activities director, in management staff, and consultant for facilities like this.  She did her homework before we moved her to the Delaney.  If you are considering an independent or assisted living home for a loved one, please visit the Delaney.  While you are there, ask for Geri, she will tell you how things are there.

It is a phenomenal assisted living facility.\nWe attended a special event, their (mole and margarita) presentation. It was fabulous! Their head chef’s actually performed and served a full course along with dessert! Unbelievable! You have to go and see this place!\nMy sister and brother in law are moving in in a month and I am thrilled for them!",

        "text": "Touchmark at Georgetown has been exceptionally helpful to our family. Mom transitioned from assisted living to memory care over the last year, and I have been amazed how great the staff is here. I have witnessed caregivers going above and beyond expectations many times while visiting, as well as on security camera footage. They have shown genuine concern for my mom and treat her with a loving respect. I think most places will be respectful. The memory care staff at Touchmark go beyond that and comfort by mom, act as a sounding board for her, engage in lengthy conversations, and show patience and kindness toward my mom. They provide her with dignity and as much autonomy as is safe for her.\n\nIf you have a loved one who needs memory care, I cannot recommend Touchmark at Georgetown highly enough. Their prices may seem high at first, but they don't hit you with \"other costs\" - you know the total amount you are paying up front. And that cost includes full service. My mom has high needs, and we pay for additional services. It's so worth it. Before getting to Touchmark, my mom would sit alone in her apartment, sometimes staying in bed all day. Here she is greeted cheerily in the morning and invited to breakfast. Most days my mom - who used to sit in bed all day - doesn't return to her room until 2 or 3pm. She is kept busy, engaged in activities or a meal until well after lunch. Later, she will leave her room for dinner around 5pm and doesn't return until 7 or 8pm - again, because she is engaged and interacting with other people. This social interaction is essential for my mom's well-being.\n\nGo talk to the memory care staff. Speak with the memory care director Randi Meachum about your loved one's needs. They don't try to \"sell you\" - they genuinely want to understand your family member's needs and are willing to work with the family to find the best solution. They are willing to address any issues or complaints without being defensive, and approach from a problem-solving perspective. I am convinced my mom could not get better service at any price. At least once a week, I remark to my wife or brother how grateful I am for the staff at Touchmark at Georgetown. Knowing my mom is in good hands and not only getting her needs met, but actually getting social interaction and thriving has provided a tremendous amount of relief for me and my family. Thank you Touchmark!!\n\n(update) I forgot to add that the facility is beautiful! There is no \"institution vibe\" at all. The grounds are pretty and inviting, residents have a gorgeous landscaped patio outside, the furniture is new and well-maintained, even the carpet is nice.",

I notice the staff are always pleasant and friendly when they pass the residents in the hallways. Katlyn is the Senior Community Life Coordinator, and she deserves to be singled out!

They emphasized Community and everyone there looked out for each other in a respectful and private way. The building itself was beautifully kept, decorated tastefully, clean, and comfortable with many places to sit and read, visit, and play games. The grounds were also well planned with safe places to walk and play with your dog.\nThe prices are more reasonable than others in town, and there are no contracts. Each person is offered a safety pendent, worn around the neck, which can be pushed in case of a fall.\nIt is a great place to live and I highly recommend it.",

From the moment we walked in, everyone was so welcoming and kind. Cristy Schuler was especially wonderful to work with — friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely caring. She took the time to answer all our questions and made the whole process easy and enjoyable.\n\nMy dad absolutely loves it here — the people are great, the activities are endless, and the food is delicious! He’s already made friends playing cards and dominos and looks forward to every meal. We are so grateful to Cristy and the entire team at The Wesleyan for creating such a warm, vibrant community.",

I moved him from Illinois, where he lived for 95 years, to Texas to be closer to me and so I could monitor his health and well being. Obviously the whole move was quite the upheaval for him. He was very resistant to move into assisted care, but Caitlin in her kind, caring, and professional manner came to our home and assured him that he would be well taken care of with a huge dose of fun along the way.  I had researched Truewood earlier and I felt this would be a good match for him and with Caitlin’s help we were able to smoothly transition him into Truewood. Once he arrived there Evelyn, the LVN on staff, went out of her way to welcome  and assure him that he would be well taken care of.  It was a hard decision to move my my dad from Illinois, to Texas, and then to assisted living, but I know he is in a safe place and well taken care of.  When I go visit him, he is always on his way to one activity or another.  I expected a difficult transition, but they keep him so busy I doubt he even thinks much about being bored or sad.  Thank you to the administration and caregivers for giving my dad a safe and happy setting to age in place. I will forever be grateful.",

Caitlyn and I talked almost every day prior to decision making and move in. Mom needed memory care and facility and staff were awesome from the first moment.

I visited almost all memory facilities within a 10 mile radius…& all had their strengths & weaknesses, but I felt that Truwood (formerly Legacy) would be the best fit for my mom. I don’t think I could have made a better choice - she LOVES it there! Her room is beautiful & spacious, the food is delicious & the staff is caring & kind! They have all sorts of fun daily programs & activities for the residents & try to integrate the memory residents in with the others as much as possible…which is nice. I hear a lot of laughter in the community…which is very telling to me!  Both the staff and the residents seem very happy, and I didn’t always find that with the other communities. I also appreciate the frequent communication & updates about my mom.  I feel like my mom is getting the best of care, and she is as happy as a clam! Who could ask for anything more?",

Caitlin knew the names of every resident and their loved ones we passed, and stopped to take the time to chat with each person. I could see the smiles on their faces as she was approaching, so I knew it wasn’t manufactured for our benefit. Everyone we have met during the transition - from the rehab, to the move-in process, has been kind and genuinely cares about the people they serve. Kindness and authentic passion for the social services people provide can’t be faked. Organizations either have genuine customer care built into their culture’s DNA or they don’t. If the leadership team models the way of customer excellence, then almost all others do the same. Truewood is what “right looks like” to us for the care of our dear loved one. Cliff and Janet",

When making the decision to move from the assisted living to memory care, I received excellent guidance from the director and nursing staff. I usually visit 3 times a week, at various times during the day. The atmosphere is welcoming and tastefully appointed. Over the years, The Legacy has been consistently clean; meals are varied, delicious and well prepared. My mother has an ostomy and her cleanliness has never been an issue and she has always been treated with respect. The staff has changed over time, but always improving with the replacements. I know it is challenging to find and keep good employees, but The Legacy continues to strive to get and retain well trained and caring staff. Although my mother usually does not participate in many activities, Shannon, the memory care activities director continues to encourage her and many times is successful!  I have found that the core staff is sincere in their caring for our family members. My mother enjoys living at The Legacy and continues to mention this and how the people are so nice and friendly.\n\nSuggestions:\n•\tStaff should be more proactive in shampooing apartment’s rugs.\n•\tResidence supplies that are ordered by The Legacy should be documented better so there is no interruption is process due to staff changes.",

We had visited many assisted living facilities before deciding which one would (hopefully) be the best for her.\nThe decision wasn’t at all difficult as one would think. We visited Legacy first. Both my husband, Steve, and I were impressed for many reasons. However, since this was our first facility to visit, we hesitated only because we didn’t want to make a “hasty” or quick decision. So we continued to view quite a few others. Nothing even compared to Legacy, not even close!\nWhat we were so impressed with is Legacy’s ability to make everyone feel at home. And that, dear friends, is the very best quality you can hope for. Whether it be the facility’s actual appearance both inside and out, or the courteous and genuinely warm staff and helpers, it wasn’t a hard decision at all for us to make. We have been so pleased with all the care and attention my mother-in-law has received, all the activities that she is offered and, above all else, the communication afforded us by Legacy.\n\nThank you,",

Our Design Consultant, Rachel, was awesome and so talented! Communication with our Construction Manager was fair at best in our view. In our opinion, Pulte Homes dropped the ball on several things during construction.   Our Purchase Agreement with Pulte Homes included installation of a Home Standby Generator. The installation of our generator was unfortunately not completed until many days after our closing. We believe that this was due to poor communication between Pulte, its subcontractors and the City of Georgetown and due to the necessary paperwork not being handled in a proper and timely manner.  Our foundation was chiseled after it was poured for the installation of two electrical outlets.  These electrical outlets were included in our original paperwork. We also contracted with Pulte Homes for the installation of window blinds.  After moving into our new home, we experienced several issues with our window blinds including not being able to open or close them easily, several of the blinds were warped and most of the valances were apparently damaged, defective or improperly installed causing them to fall to the floor. Our Pulte Customer Service Representative, Wesley, has been kind and very responsive! Finally, before we signed our Purchase Agreement we were told by Del Webb that a new Amenity Center was going to be built within walking distance of our new home.  In February 2025 we were advised by Del Webb that construction on the new Amenity Center was scheduled to start in April 2025 and that the target date for completion was some time in Q2 or Q3 2026. As of this writing, construction on the new Amenity Center has not commenced and we have not been able to obtain a target date range for the commencement of construction from Del Webb. Overall, our construction experience was good in part and not so good in part. We are happy to be living in Sun City Texas!",

They also have Halcyon Health Care in the building to help residents with any extra in-home care they may need. A good move for all of us to a wonderful facility!!",

After my father passed, my Mother moved in with us and while we thoroughly enjoyed having her and she enjoyed being with her grandkids everyday, she is still very active and I felt bad for her sitting alone at home while we were at school/work.\n\nShe has been at Provident now for six months and has joined the choir, the Wii Bowling team, the bean bag baseball team, has joined fitness challenges, and has made friends her own age. She also enjoys the outings they have to Museums and plays and has even taken my daughters with her on outings. For days when she’s not feeling social they have movies on their in-house channels in addition to her regular cable and internet.\n\nI feel she is well taken care of at Provident. She enjoys the food there and probably eats better in the day than she did when she was alone at my house. There is a maid service, and even a driver that will take her to shopping, medical appointments and grocery shopping.\n\nShe has fully enjoyed her fellow residents and the staff there, all of whom she is on a first name basis.\n\nI encourage to go visit if you are looking for a senior living apartment. Thanks, Provident!",

The first thing that struck both of us was that we felt like we were on a cruise ship with special conversation rooms, a library, Billiard room, poker room, a fabulous daily salad bar, noon and night, and apartments loaded with great features like bars in the bathroom and electrical outlets a plenty. We were immediately reminded of fabulous cruises we had taken. There was a fountain as we entered with fish, swimming in it, music to our ears. There were friendly people everywhere who greeted us. The dining room was extensive and well laid out, full of decorations and pictures. Weekly housekeeping was offered to keep our rooms neat, clean, beds made. And the staff are just excellent. But let us talk about the most important piece probably right now (after. our two years here). That is our managers, Joie and Jay!  It is hard to describe to the outside world what it means for us to have a mother and a father figure who really really care about us. They are a loving, caring couple Who are everywhere, at all times of the day or night, exactly where they need to be to be of help to someone. Their way of handling all of us, of being committed to see every server, and every helper in the building is taken care of, of the way they handle issuesbrought before them with care, patience and concern, is just what a resident like this needs We always hear, the residence talking about how they feel like they’re part of a family. That comes right down from the top! Let me not forget Holly, our activities Director Who is also so committed to her job of pleasing us and keeping us interested in varying activities. And Pete, our driver, who goes out of his way to take us to appointments with wheelchairs, relators, etc. He gets off the bus and often holds the door to the office for people. Again, always with a smile. The staff members who work on the desk also go way above and beyond with their abilities to help us and serve us. Let us not omit all the dedicated, caring, managers, and servers in the dining room. They always have a smile, remember our names, get special treats for us when they see us coming, and are so appreciated. And one last place, definitely not to be overlooked, is our phenomenal kitchen, our very obliging and excellent chef and all of the staff that works in the kitchen. There are probably six languages spoken in that kitchen and everything works like clockwork within the budget They are allotted. There are always two options for entrées and beautiful desserts, rolls and extra treats. On Sundays, Jay, gets up extra early to get special donuts, made here in Round Rock, coming in with boxes of donuts , especially for us. Sean and I were evacuated from Sanibel Island in Florida with the last hurricane, losing everything, including our car, and really believe that we were brought by the universe to the perfect place for us. Please come join us.❤️",

The staff is amazing and this includes Peter, Tyler, who takes care of maintenance and Terry who takes care of keeping all of the public areas looking clean. We appreciate the Amberlin Management and Sales team as well.\n\nThe residents are wonderful. There are so many activities to enjoy including get togethers ,themed events, bocce, pickleball, the pool, the fitness center and so many other activities. The location is superb. We like to walk and can walk to the HEB, restaurants and the outside mall and we are also near Baylor Scott & White. At the same time, you can just get in your vehicle and be at all of these places in minutes.  I've gotten involved with Pickleball and there are many fellow residents who I've gotten to know through this sport.\n\nThis is an amazing Active Adults Community and we are so glad that we moved here. Be sure to check it out.",

        "text": "The topic of elder care is a deeply personal one for many. When my mother's needs of care were beyond what we could provide, the search for a proper facility became a focus for us. I toured and interviewed a dozen or so facilities in the Central Texas area. We settled on Autumn Leaves, and it has become a second home for my mother and a source of reassurance for our family.\n\nThe care provided to my mother has been nothing short of exceptional. From skilled nursing care to daily activities and everything in between, the entire team's dedication is palpable. The compassion with which they approach their work is reflected in the subtle nuances of care – the softness of tone when assisting with a task, the patience during mealtimes, and the love shown during moments my mother needs it most. It is a level of care that extends far beyond professional obligation; it is genuine and heartwarming. We feel mom is treated as an individual, with unique needs and preferences. The attention to personal care is meticulous. The staff took the time to understand my mother's history, likes, and dislikes, adjusting their approach with astuteness and finesse. Mom is encouraged to participate in activities. The calendar is filled with a variety of activities that engage and bring her joy. I've gotten photos of her dancing with a staff member, enjoying music played by guest musicians, and \"bowling.\"\n\nAutumn Leaves has created an environment that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also inherently designed for the safety and comfort of its residents. The facility is immaculate, providing a clean and serene environment that is conducive to comfort and happiness. The security measures in place are reassuring, ensuring that the vulnerable are protected and any risks are mitigated proactively.The staff is diligent in providing for the residents' needs, ensuring that they are comfortable not just physically, but also emotionally. My family and I find solace in the knowledge that mom is in such good hands.\n\nMy experience with Autumn Leaves in Georgetown has been a positive and enriching one, a beacon of hope in what can be a daunting phase of life for many. I write this piece not just to share my journey but to adamantly state that there are sanctuaries where the elderly are not just cared for, they are cherished.\n\nThe peace of mind that comes with knowing my mother is safe and comfortable is immeasurable.",

        "text": "Mother is doing well. 2nd month. Dogs can visit too with vaccination. Mom adjusted after a couple of months. I believe it is the family's decision making this emotionally tormenting time more aggressious with only 1 star reviews. These 1 star reviews have not seen some of the places I have visited over the last 2 years.\n\nWhen mom first arrived back in July 2021, I came twice a week. First night mom was tired and I just put her in bed and she went into deep slumber. I gave The Reserves at Georgetown 5 Stars 🌟 because the program is ****Montessori. If you are not familiar with Montessori it's basically the caretakers gives care at the level the individual is at in their life.\n\nMy mother is absolutely physically healthy. Her brain may have lost memory but her body and character is still blossoming. Michele and Dorothy are two of my favorite employees there. They send me pictures, helped me in my personal grieving process. They keep me updated as I am a traveling nurse (25 years as RN). Giving the entire facility 1 star 🌟 as a health-care professional auditor shows \"anger.\" Realistic expectations has to be understood by people who are not aware what actually is happening when you are not there. I am there. I see people doing pleasant activities or doing whatever they physically can do based upon Montessori.\n\nMy mother plays the Grand Piano daily. Her last facility made all residents stay in their rooms because of fear of CV19 and told her not to play the piano because of noise. My mother also functions as a \"helper\" in the nutrition department. She needs to be worthy or goal oriented so I asked if she could have a \"Job.\" Mom believes she is there as a nutrition attendant. She absolutely loves telling me about her new role. I can't tell you how many things Michele and Dorothy do Monday-Friday to ensure my mom is happy. My mom is a hard person to manage because she is a born princess.\n\nYes, my mother can be a pain because she wants tons of attention but the facility gives my mother anything she needs and more. Her hair stylist colors and cuts her hair, mother's room is beautiful and spacious. The janitorial workers are always cleaning and shampooing the carpet, furniture, and touch surfaces. I maybe biased because I am a nurse. I don't see how anyone there could have bed bugs? The place is luxury living. The price point is right at moderate for accommodation.\n\nMy mother never danced in her life but is now full on dancing, fashion shows, and of course her avid love of music and Korean Netflix Movie.\n\nI decorated my mother's suite. I am happy she has this beautiful place with real opportunities to continue to live forward to than to be at my home. We were so guarded that we both slept all the time and I had to tell my entire neighborhood to watch out for my mother wondering.\n\nMother says she is having fun. She also has friends too. As with all friends, she has fall outs but they make up after few days. She is like 16 years old (mentally) but actually 74. I am confident that no one there goes to work saying they are going to be \"nasty, mean, unprofessional\" intentionally. I haven't seen that but I had to rewrite my post because the Good News is our community does have a smaller 43 beds Memory Care Only Facility right in the heart ❤ of Georgetown,TX.\n\nThank you guys at The Reserves. You are amazing and I look forward to coming by soon. P.S. My mother says the food is delicious.\n\nThank you again! God bless you 🙏 and all His workers there at The Reserves in Georgetown!!!!",

        "text": "My heartfelt advice is to not move your loved one to Autumn Leaves at Georgetown.  They are not trained, staffed or skilled to deal with patients requiring memory care, regardless of what they tell you on your tour.   An outstanding memory care facility should work to divert patients and provide cognitive stimulation activities, physical activities (especially outdoors), gardening, art or music therapy, group activities, sensory stimulation, individualized activity plans and educational or informative sessions.  Autumn Leaves shuffles patients between the TV room and the dining room and has a morning exercise session that is led with minimal enthusiasm or attempt to engage the patients.    The building has a few beautiful outdoor, protected areas but in the two months my loved one was there, only one day saw the doors unlocked so the space could be utilized.   The majority of the patients spend most of their day crammed into one  living room with a random sitcom on the television.   A small group of patients walk the halls for hours at a time.\n\nThe line staff for the most part tries hard to care for the patients  but they are understaffed, overworked and only able to provide the most basic of care.  My loved one was also under the care of hospice.  Had we not had their oversight and direct care the situation would have been much worse.  Basic necessities were often neglected including feeding assistance,  toileting, clean bedding, clean clothing and most critically, timing of scheduled medications and nutrition.  Staff turnover is extremely high which exacerbates the situation and any needed sense of familiarity for the patient.\n\nOver the time period we were at Autumn Leaves there were many issues raised to management and the responses were either defensive, denials or proclaiming that they would do better.  However they did not.   Any escalation to the corporate office also resulted in no improvement.  At the point where we realized we needed to move our loved one to a facility with a higher standard of care, their health unexpectedly declined rapidly and we stayed in place to maintain hospice continuity.   My sadness at losing my loved one is overwhelming but overshadowed by knowing the discomfort and poor care that they endured from Autumn Leaves in their final days.",

        "text": "My mother has been at Autumn Leaves for sometime now. I started to visit her in June 2024 with my daughter. I went 3 times with my daughter each time. She had to clean up bathroom full of BM. Take trash out. My daughter stopped going I go couple times a week and weekend. Autumn Leaves is a horrible place. I found my mother covered with feces. Plus her bedding, clothes and walls. Autumn leaves is not a certified memory care facility. It's listed as a nursing home. Autumn leaves doesn't have extra annuities. No chief . No farm to table food. No salon, no activities ( they just hired.Library. Movie night. Laundry service is not available right away. I waited 4 weeks. Housekeeping comes every 2 days. Movement exercises. It's all false advertising. Never an administration on duty ( should have 1) 24/7. Residents keys were taken away so they roam the hallways like Zombies. After lunch everyone inTV room aka zombie room.  Beautiful courtyard secured no they don't let residents outside. Now the do. I have called the health and human state agency 3 times. I've been there on weekends with only 1 caregiver and medication tech. Never enough staff which residents don't get care need. I had a meeting with VIP of operations from corporate office. We discussed serious issues. I even suggested outside volunteers. Beauty College learning to volunteer services. This will help students learn and residents could have an operating salon. No call button in room. No water available to drink. Residents are on their own. Even if my mother was not a resident. I would advocate for others residents. If no family is visiting they don't know how degrading and disrespectful this facility really is towards their family. I have pictures. Videos and audio. Caregivers are mostly there for the patients. Many don't stay long due to lack of support from management. Autumn Leaves is one the most expensive facility in Georgetown. Money that is not used to take care of your family member. VIP of operations made convenient problems solving issues. I have called her and messaged her no response. I contacted Senator Ted Cruz office about violating at Autumn Leaves Georgetown. I will be contacting local news channels to report false advertisement, one staff for whole facility. No administration is available. Never in office or building. Staff have no support, low wages, overworked, training?, caregivers cook but they have to have a food handler permit which a major violation. Please don't let Autumn Leave tell you about all the wonderful things they offer because they don't. Autumn Leaves is about getting more residents for financial reasons. Your welcome to ask me more questions , pictures and audio. Please visit as many facilities your can and I pray you find one that is honest. You can feel comfortable living your love one there. I worry nonstop about my mom. My situation is different I can't move her out. I have tried many many times to contact corporate in Grapevine Texas. I will make sure Autumn Leaves with have standards, guidelines, residents in mind and heart. Improve caregivers support, training , pay increases and what they job duties are. I was a childcare director for 30 years. Common sense if you don't have good/great staff. You will have a good business. Please be aware that everything I wrote is true facts.",

The number of staff that it takes to meet the needs of residents is considerable and we were delighted at the warm relationships built from the personnel at this facility with our mother. I have memories of a variety of staff members across the building helping her with a need, providing a hug or a smile, showing kindness and love, respecting her personal preferences, understanding her facial expressions or loss of words, letting her visit their work space, painting her fingernails, providing her with snacks, keeping her hands busy, helping her with movement issues, etc. The friendly staff was a huge reason our mother was content.\n\nThe community atmosphere at The Reserve, with other residents around her dealing with similar issues, also helped our mother not feel so alone in the progression of dementia. She developed friendships with other residents and was able to spend time with others in a safe and caring place that met her daily needs.\n\nOur mom especially enjoyed music at The Reserve whether it was special musical presentations and guests or music playing in the living areas. She appreciated the coffee table books on a variety of subjects with lots of pictures, and the pillows on the furniture. Our mother loved looking at the outdoor spaces or walking around the courtyards.

It's been easy to get to know our neighbors because residents wear name tags and have gone out of their way to make us feel welcome to the community. The management and staff treat the residents like family. Almost everyone knows each other by their first names. The dining room has a chef with a professional staff that do a wonderful job providing a diversified menu of delicious food and excellent service. We have really enjoyed their Sunday Brunches, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. The social calendar is very thoughtfully constructed with creative activities that are always a lot of fun! They have a beautiful movie theatre and show current titles as well as classics each week. They also have a hair salon in the complex and the beauticians do a wonderful job.

Well, we luckily found an RLC close to Austin called Lakeline Oaks located in Cedar Park, TX.  The minute I walked in the door and saw the beautiful Koi pond, I breathed a sigh of relief. I was home. Lakeline Oaks is second to none in their care of the residents. The staff is just outstanding. Our managers, Kenny and Marilou, are a joy: personable, thoughtful, and hands-on in making sure the residents are happy. We are also privileged to have an award winning chef, Chris, who, along with his sous chef, Ryan, prepares delicious food in an upscale, clean and well organized dining room run by Marc. Our servers are courteous and in every way, exceptional. We have extremely helpful  and caring concierges, Blake, Tosh and Daniel. The facilities are well cared for and the common areas bright and clean. There are many amenities: Weekly maid service - our housekeeper is Margarita and she is a doll.  Maintenance is run by Billy, a talented and reliable magician who can fix just about any ole' thing. Tracy is our bus driver and provides safe transportation for those who no longer drive. We have a busy hair and nail salon, a billiards room, a library, a poker room, a gym, and a theatre, just to name a few. Our Entertainment Director, Dina, organizes an abundance of fun activities from bingo, to card games, to yoga, to religious programs, to live entertainment during Friday Happy Hours. Residents can also host fun activities on their own. My favorite is \"Round Table\" run by one of our residents, Bob, where we discuss current events.  I would recommend anyone looking to make the move into independent living in the Austin area of Texas, to give our Senior Living Consultant, Jacqueline, a call and make an appointment to tour  Lakeline Oaks, in Cedar Park, TX.\n...and, as the old saying goes....\"We'll leave the lights on...\"",

Rhunda and all the caregivers were so kind and patient with my mom, making her feel comfortable. They gave her so much attention and love and treated her like their grandmother. We are so thankful for the staff taking such wonderful care of my mom.",

I have referred a friend here and they were most pleased with the compassion that the entire staff and team provided. The dedication that the owner, Alessandro has for his residents, families and staff, is a beautiful blessing.  Rhunda, the home's manager, is dedicated to exceptional quality care and love to each of the residents as well. The home is always clean and smells wonderful.  You can simply feel the love when you walk in.  I can't wait for them to expand because we need more personal care homes with Alessandro's dedication to detail.  The Primrose tends to stay full because it is THE BEST.  Even if you think it isn't quite time, contact them to place your loved one on their waiting list.  You won't be disappointed even if it is for a much needed break to recuperate from your devotion and dedication to your family member.   Rhunda and Alessandro are there to help you with the next steps, even if it may not be time for a move, just yet.",

I was quickly, and consistently have been, blown away by the genuine care, patience and immense sweetness shown to my grandmother by staff members.\n\nI’m a helicopter granddaughter and have a 24/hr camera in my grandmother’s room. I check it often. I’ve been brought to tears by the patience, and tenderness that my grandmother is treated with especially in her most vulnerable moments. Dawn, Jay, Cleo, and Jennifer are staff members who I’ve spent meaningful time with and have absolutely blown by mind with their sweetness and care. Kasey, the ED is extraordinary. She is infinitely more involved, present, and invested than the ED at my grandmothers past facility.  It’s evident how deeply and truly she cares. It’s beautiful to see her spending time playing games and socializing with the patients. She clearly loves it and them. These people truly care. I don’t know how Kasey does it, but every single person I’ve seen her hire into the facility seems to possess genuine passion and care for the people they take care of. These people have one of the most difficult jobs in the world - and they show up with love and care every day. In my eyes they’re angels.\n\nCouldn’t be happier with our decision to bring my grandmother to Avalon. During Nanna’s time at other facilities she was very unhappy to be away from home. It was beautiful and such a relief to see how at peace Nanna is at Avalon. I haven’t seen her this happy and peaceful since the initial fall that required her to have 24hr support. I think this is because she knows she is cared for and in good hands and enjoys her connection with the people caring for her. I sleep easy at night knowing my sweet grandmother is in their care. I’m so grateful.  Thank you Kacey and team.",

Some years ago my father-in-law was in a memory care facility, and it was nowhere as nice as Avalon. We asked many questions and spoke to several different facilities. We spoke to our attorney that dealt in elder care. From him we learned what questions to ask and what to look for. The staff at Avalon was very caring and Jim soon adapted to living there. He even got gifts from the staff on his birthday. It was not a negative experience for him and for that we are so thankful.",

        "text": "Even though he lived here at Avalon only a short time before passing away, my father was well taken care of. The staff is dedicated and kind. During his first few days, Dad was disoriented and scared at times. The staff anticipated this and gave him extra time and attention, sometimes just sitting in his room with him, watching TV or reading aloud to him. When they were briefly locked down for a positive Covid test, the staff made sure each resident got extra attention. One young staff member spent an HOUR in my dad's room, helping me get the new TV set up! My family and I were free to come any time and we were always welcome to participate in whatever activity was at hand. Dad was always clean and his room and bedding always fresh.\nThere is such a negative connotation with \"putting your parents in a home\" but that's unfortunate and unfair. The vast majority of people working in assisted living/memory care/nursing homes genuinely care for their residents, and treat them with kindness and gentleness. Besides, few and far between are those of us who can center their entire lives around physically caring for an elderly relative. My father, unfortunately, needed years of care before he passed. By allowing others like Avalon to help me with Dad's care, I was able to remain my father's daughter instead of becoming his nursemaid. I was able to avoid burnout, and able to walk in love alongside him during his final years. Avalon gave me that gift. Thank you, Avalon.",

My mother has been a resident for almost a year; I live close by and see her most every day.   She gets the medical, nursing, doctor and therapy care she needs; the staff quickly learned her likes and dislikes (give her something chocolate and sweet and she’s your good buddy!) and they treat her with love and affection.  What I appreciate most when I visit, however, is not so much how the staff interacts with her, because when I am visiting she usually does not require a lot of attention; it is the attention and encouragement I see the other residents getting when they have no family members present.  Problems are handled calmly; everyone is treated with respect.  Seeing the staff care for the residents in such personal ways gives me confidence that my mom also receives this same care when I am not there!",

I worried about her when I wasn’t there. Two staff for the whole community of 30 people. I even heard from a staff member that they would “hide” my mom in her room when they were giving tours. My mom needed a higher level of care than she was being provided and that’s exactly what she’s given here at Sundance. The best decision I ever made (regarding my mom’s care) was to move her. Sundance has become a part of my family. Holly, Renate, Sarah, Kelly and Jillian are all incredibly nice and helpful. The caregivers love the residents and it’s nice to see the same faces when I walk in to visit. They have slowly come to know my mom even better than I do. Anytime someone talks to me about needing care for their loved one, I tell them Sundance without a moment’s hesitation. I know they will be as pleased with care as I have always been. It helps that the building was well thought out. It is resident-friendly and promotes the residents’ ability to be independent. I also regularly eat meals with my mom and can attest that the food is delicious.",

I can not be any happier with the care my mom is getting.  I am at peace with how my mom is flourishing in the Montessori program at Sundance. It is unbelievable how they provide a purpose for daily living. Montessori approach is creating an environment that engages people to be independent in every aspect of themselves which in turn gives them a sense of purpose, dignity, and trust. I always thought, if I ever had children I would send them to Montessori school. Switching roles with my mother from child to caregiver I am happy I still held on to that dream and chose Montessori for my mom. I have kept my promise not to just “put my mom away in a nursing home”.. She is LIVING at Sundance (her new home) with amazing people, thriving, and enjoying stellar quality care. The staff have been like no other- I have several of their phone numbers in my phone along with the owner Matt. They are ALWAYS within a texting reach or phone call. They always respond! During these hard times with Covid, Lena and Renate have been so understanding and accommodating with setting up Skype and FaceTime for my mother and I to visit any time I want. The owner, Matt... There is no other person on this planet I have ever met who has genuinely cared so much for me and my mom. He has spent a lot of time with me, especially in the beginning of the transition from home to Sundance. He sympathized right along with me when times were hard and always reassured me it will get better. He has really set the bar extremely high! Matt has also included me in weekly webinars about Montessori and Dementia which have been so very helpful for me to understand the disease. I knew literally nothing about dementia before I met Matt. We were lost and I was very scared I was not going to be able to find proper help for my mom who is a retired nurse. I only wanted the best because I know she deserves it- she has cared for people her whole life... Sundance has changed our lives for the better because of how they respect my mom for the life she led prior to dementia and they give her purpose. Also, Matt has been excellent through the whole Covid shutdown. Very very strict on keeping the residents safe beyond all means and I really appreciate that. His staff has made unbelievable commitments to 100% shelter in place other than going to Sundance to take care of some of the most vulnerable people for work. I have felt so safe for my mom to be there when other senior facilities have fallen short and had covid breakouts. I could seriously write a booklet on how Sundance is the bees knees lol. I feel like the luckiest girl and I feel like my mom must have been a saint in her past life because she is the luckiest of all. Oh! and my mom loves the food. All the residents have a hand in menu planning whether it is cotton candy or NY strip steaks, Sundance accommodates. She likes to tell me she is the \"Dietary Director\".. Simply warms my heart.",

Then, he was pushed by another member ( they have dimenta- these things happen) but when it came time for an incident report, they tried to hand us false documentation that stated he fell. Until we played a recording of a worker stating he was pushed by such member. Then, he ended up weeks later after no one got him help, needing hip surgery. After that surgery he went back to sunflower. They did not give him the proper care, cleaning, taking care of him etc. he had to go back to the hospital for emergency surgery to get rid of MRSA. ( when I visited they had dirty clothes and diapers shoved in random places in the room). This place is not fit to take care of absolutely any human being, let alone an elderly person in need. I am so disheartened by how they did everything. When we removed him, not one person asked how he was doing. How he is, or felt sorry for what has happened to him. If you love your loved ones; do not send them to this place. Please.",

It is clear through their usage of the Montessori approach that they put their residents needs first. In the conversations I have had, and in the personal reviews and onsite visits I have conducted, this facility is top notch. The owner, Matt Stanley is extremely driven to care for his residents, and it shows through his actions and regular on-site activities. If you dont believe me, call the community and ask to connect with Matt. Matt knows each of his residence names, their stories, their likes and their dislikes. He is a true leader within his communities and our community.\n\nOne of the biggest issues in the US right now is that many tend to lose site of our seniors, they forget that they are people too, and often they become invisible. Fortunately for all of us there is Sundance. The Sundance team clearly takes time to learn each residents abilities, likes, and uses those to help guide them while in their care.\n\nChoosing a care giver/memory care facility for those we love can be an extremely difficult task, but knowing there are people and organizations out there like the Sundace team helps me sleep at night. keep up the great work, and thank you for your incredible efforts in taking care of our seniors!",

She had lived alone for so long and fought us (her family) whenever we tried to get her out to mix and mingle. It took a little time, but not nearly as long as I had anticipated. The morning crew made her feel so welcome, always having her \"cup of the good stuff\" (aka hot chocolate) ready by the time she reached her chair. It was great seeing her start to express joy and excitement again, even cracking jokes from out of nowhere. Her speech therapist noted the change. She tested higher on her assessments at Sundance than when at home. The socialization and activities that you all have set up made the difference. I will be forever grateful!!",

My daughter and I were on our way for our visit when she received a call from the OWNER Matt Stanley which we thought was strange. Matt said he was ordering a mobile x-ray because he was acting like his leg hurt. He was in bed when we arrived at the facility. The direct care worker (DCW) said he had been in bed since her duty began and told us that the DCW on the previous shift said they showered him and noticed he would not stand on his leg.\n\nWe get to his room, and he's lying in bed, rolling his hands and having a frown on his face. My daughter called his name and tried to sit on the bed near him, and he grimaced. She pulled back the covers, and I tell you I went screaming, \"Call 911 right now and get an ambulance here NOW\". What kind of freakin place would leave a DV patient in a bed all day with a dislocated hip! Ray Charles could see his hip was dislocated.\n\nThe fire department and ems came, and they were so gentle with him and made sure even though they knew he didn't understand, they took the time to tell him what they were doing. They lifted him like a baby and took him to the hospital for surgery.\n\nMy daughter goes every day to make sure he is OK. Just think, if she had not been there, and how long would they let him remain in that condition? Check on your people, please.",

The facility is small, so the ratio of staff to residents is really good.  In addition, there is an onsite Hospice and Home Health facility that was able to complete my Mom's care until she passed away. Terra focuses on her staff and does everything she can to keep them happy working there. Many have been there for years.  Also, you get to know the caregivers well.  She has two resident care managers, that are always available, and extremely responsive to any questions or updates.  They are happy to communicate by text, email or phone.  The facility has alot of natural light and open areas.  The kitchen is like one in a lovely home.  They even have a labradoodle named Sophie that lives there and visits every so often.

From all the parts of my brother’s care over those years he had beyond above average care from all the loving folks that have worked there over the years. I don't know how they find their employees but whatever method they use is has to be very thorough to have such great staff. I have visited many care facilities over the years and never have I seen such loving and caring folks all in one place. With many folks with mental and physical afflictions of all sorts they handle it well. The atmosphere in the place in my opinion is uplifting to a patient in their conditions. I always felt at home with all that worked there! They love to see family involved with the persons they care for. Of course with humans there can be a problem crop up but if that ever happens they are quick to act, they listen to family concerns, and the patient is at their upmost importance. I doubt that there is another facility like this on in the area.\nI'm saying you will have to look long and hard to find any better facility to care for you loved one!!! My brother was buried today from complications of Alzheimer's which had suffer may years with along with a stroke that disabled him at the early stages of Alzheimer.\nI thank everyone at this facility for the excellent care and love you bestowed on my brother and my family members.\nLarry Cohrs",

Of course, you want to be prepared and provide your loved one with the best care possible.  My family and I were extremely lucky to find A Touch of Home for my Mom. The environment they have created at A Touch of Home is calm, safe, and has become familiar for my Mom.  I am confident that she is provided with the safety, care, dignity, and quality of life she deserves on the daily basis.\n\nA Touch of Home implements daily routines that have helped ground my Mom and eliminate some confusion and frustration she previously experienced while living at home. The activities such as group exercise, games and crafts have helped give my Mom a sense of independence and accomplishment.\n\nThe owners and staff at A Touch of Home continue to be extremely patient and help my Mom through any difficult experiences. Their trained and licensed staff including Doctors and nurses are available 24/7, ensuring that my Mom always receives the assistance she needs at any time of the day or night. I have complete peace of mind that my Mom receives the utmost best quality of care at A Touch of Home. I highly recommend this assisted living facility to anyone looking for care for their loved one.",

Some directors and support staff were recently released.  As such, there is a lot of new norms being established at time of this writing.\n\nMy mother is a newer memory care resident, and this review is of her first 6 months.\nPros:\n*  Staff is diligent in supporting my mother.   Bathing, simple medical needs, feeding, all meet expectations.\n*  Our room spacious and is well apportioned; 2 closets and full walk-in shower.  Overlooking garden areas.\n*  Memory care area is very large compared to many other facilities in the Round Rock/Cedar Park areas.  This allows residents to move around, and, if desired, obtain some level of privacy.\n*  They have normal daily activities.  But best are the days the little service dogs come and visit with residents.\n*  Occasional wine mixer events.\n*  The experience with the memory care staff, for me, has been excellent.  They are communicative when issues are found.  And available to me without any managerial filtering (a welcome change from other facilities.\n\nCons:\n*  Management turnover in our 6 months has been very, very high.  At times I don't know whom to contact.\n*  On-site playground needs updating.  Our grandkids came and found the site lacked end of slide soft landing materials, and the wooden playscapes are in dire need of sanding to remove spurs.  Better yet, full replacement with more modern materials.\n*  Meals is always an item that can be improved.  In general, it is just okay.  A wider selection of soft foods would be welcomed.\n*  Within the first month one hearing aid was lost within the memory care center.  Which of course required replacement and was an avoidable cost if properly managed.",

The Executive Director, Maryjane, knows how to run a memory facility.  She is very involved with the residents and extremely responsive to family.  I loved the activities that were planned as it broke up the monotony of the day to day for my Mother.  They hosted some beautiful parties that were such fun and festive. My Mom was always clean and she enjoyed the food.  Her room always spelled good and was clean. She had 2 cats and several staff members really took to them and helped to clean their litter boxes and feed them.  When you are placing a loved one, no place is perfect - even home with a full-time caregiver.  What makes a difference is getting to know the leadership and the staff and making frequent visits.  The Cottages truly became part of what I consider our family. We will miss seeing their faces and their love and care.",

        "text": "It has taken me nearing two years to write this review regarding this facility. This facility has an interesting dynamic – management does not know how to speak to their employees or diffuse or handle situations “professionally”. I observed while visiting on several occasions the way this specific facility is ran and I would not recommend residential stays whether it be respite or long term for your family member nor individuals seeking employment. I have had family in other facilities, and I know it is hard at times with staffing and things can at times go undone, but this place has no recourse. The director and her team play a façade when you first admit, and that charm and professionalism goes away. I have heard their employees’ discussing things about situations they have been in and seen first-hand the hostility from afar. I commend the hired hands that are working to try to facilitate the best they can for the people living there and us as families trusting that our loved ones are cared for. I hope this review helps anyone who is in question of The Cottages of Chandler Creek in Round Rock, TX.",

My Mother has been in care for almost 5 years and is was anything but easy at first for me and my Mother. The Cottages staff and Supervisor's had my back every step of the way and let me tell you it was a lot. I needed them and they were not only there in person for me and my Mother (of course) but they where there for me via texting, calls, Facebook, whenever I needed them. To this day I will call them \"My family\". My Mother calls The Cottages her \"home\" and even goes to groups now! It is amazing. I have never been disrespected by any of the staff only love, respect and kindness. I have considered moving but would never leave my Mother and I would never want her to leave The Cottages. This is my experience.",

        "text": "I have been meaning to write this review for some time as a thank you for my Dad who had the privelege of living at The Cottages in Round Round for the last two to three years of his life. When he was discharged from the hospital he was heavily sedated as he had tried to \"escape\" many times. They were actually trying to place him at a secure psychiatric facility but there was no bed available, thank god. The Cottages assured me that they were a no restraints facility and could deal with him in a humane manner.\nAfter the first day, I knew he was in good hands, they explained to me that instead of putting him in a raised bed with protective bars so he would not fall during the night, they had decided to put his mattress on the floor, that way he could move around without injuring himself. I knew then that they knew what they were doing. He loved it there, actually recovered very well. His doctor doubted that he would be able to get around without a walker; he was walking on his own within a few days, and he was happy! He made new friends! Unfortunately after two and a half years he worsened, with very advanced alzheimers and had much difficulty eating and swallowing, still they took excellent care of him until the very end; he died peacefully in his bed from pneumionia and asphyxiation, with our permission, we had granted him hospice care status so he would not need to go back to the hospital which would have only been a nightmare for him. The director even attended his funeral, we hugged and cried together; he was well liked there. This is a very special place for alzheimer patients; and I don't think this was an exception, most fellow residents seemed to be happy there and told me so. And yes, I have been to many other places where that was not the case. God bless The Cottages at Chandler Creek.",

She has a history of digestive issues and that is one of the main reasons we had to move  her.  The food at Sage Valley is delicious.  They realize the negative impact that processed food has on the elderly and strive to serve freshly prepared meals.  Chef Charles prepares not only healthy food, it’s tasty. This has enabled our mother to eat and enjoy the food prepared at Sage Valley.  She’s also able to enjoy the company of other residents during meal time.\nSince moving to Sage Valley, mom has already developed friendships and has participated in more activities and outings than she has in the last year.  Samantha, the activities director, is so caring and has made mom feel very welcome there.\nAll the staff, from med techs to meal servers, have made mom feel at home in her new location.  This has been such a positive change for our mother.  Moving her to Sage Valley has been the best Christmas gift we could have ever received.",

We never felt talked down to nor incapable of changing our decision during the process. She is a fantastic listener who truly desired to understand our personal situation. Heritage Law is clearly mission driven to succeed in supporting their clients. From the first call to the office through the last step of finishing our estate planning, Bonnie Siversten blessed us with hospitality, answers via phone calls, and always with a smile.

I could not use my mother’s estate firm as they are in California, but they highly recommended this law firm.\nWhen I returned to Texas, I gave them a call and they set up an initial meeting less than a week away. Kim was my first point of contact, and she made sure that I got a good head start on what I needed to consider and bring to the introductory meeting.\nI met with Regina a few days later and she walked me through the entire process under Texas law and explained every detail I asked about in a way that made sense to me. I walked away from that meeting with a much broader view of how I wanted to structure my trust.\nI made what I thought was a comprehensive outline of what I wanted and submitted it by email. Kim got back to me a few days later and we walked through my outline and she pressed me for as much detail as possible in order to have the finished trust meet my expectations.\nIn the end, the signing meeting went flawlessly.  We didn’t need to change a single word and I cannot imagine how it could have been better planned, constructed or executed.  From start to finish, the process and end result were clear, concise and exactly what I wanted. Both Regina and Kim are exceptional at what they do and how they do it.  I look forward to working with them over the years as life changes things.\n(Six stars…)",

        "text": "what I am reviewing here isn't any actual engagement - it never came to that - it is the lack of response. After an initial consultant visit where we agreed on 3 items I needed legal assistance with, I never heard back from the firm. I called back 2 weeks later, asking for an update and they told me I had not returned the 'Engagement forms' (or whatever they are called to get going). When I explained I never received such forms, the office clerk (not sure if that is the correct title, no disrespect) apologized and promised me a callback the next day to get it all sorted out. Now it's 4 weeks later and I am still waiting for the callback (well, not really, I found help elsewhere).\nI was looking forward working with Sheehan because I totally see the benefit of what they claim on their website:\n>>> Larger firms can be constantly tied up in countless cases — while you may be able to reach the front desk, it can be difficult to get into contact with the attorney who is actually representing you <<<\nHowever, for me, the exact opposite was true.",

I was the executor of a complicated estate and I had a lot of questions. Farren and Helen were patient with me and took the time to answer all of my questions in full detail.  They were very responsive with communications and filings to the court as well as with beneficiaries and debt claimants. I highly recommend Sheehan Law for all of your estate needs such as the creation of wills, power of attorney, medical power of attorney, and in the probating of wills as well. These matters are too important to leave to a firm that you don't trust. You can trust Sheehan Law!",

Rates are very reasonable, one of the lowest in the industry and I love their risk based tailored portfolios. Their service is comprehensive and includes portfolio management, personal finance, happy hour, video updates, email updates, classes, and in-house accountant. And did I mention their endgame lounge/speakeasy!! Such a spectacular space! David is my financial advisor and he is a very approachable and knowledgeable fiduciary. Always available when I have questions and provide valuable feedback/advice. It has been a great experience having them on my team and I look forward to many more years to come.

        "text": "PICKLELAND SUCKS\n\nHere is why...\n\nMy experience with PickleLand was so unprofessional and discouraging that I feel obligated to share it. I contacted the club to join their 4.0+ group and connected my DUPR profile, where I hold a 4.8 DUPR rating. I was also personally invited by multiple players already in the group. By any normal club’s standards, that should have been more than enough.\n\nInstead, I was told that PickleLand’s own “in-house rating system” overrides DUPR entirely. In other words, your earned rating doesn’t really matter — you only play if they approve you. And that approval is based purely on their opinion, not transparent criteria.\n\nWhen I spoke with the general manager, Zach, he refused to let me into the group because my DUPR reliability score is a 1. The reason is simple: I don’t play tournaments, though I play frequently. Reliability is not the same as ability — something any knowledgeable racquet-sports professional understands. I calmly explained this, along with the fact that I’ve earned my 4.8 over time.\n\nInstead of listening, Zach told me I would “water down the program” and insisted I pay for an assessment with one of their pros before I’d be allowed to join. For context, I’ve been a racquet-sports director for over 20 years. I have never seen a club impose this kind of arbitrary barrier at the 4.0 level. Maybe at the elite 5.0 level — but certainly not here.\n\nWhat truly shocked me was Zach’s attitude. The moment I pushed back and tried to clarify my rating, he became irritated and dismissive. He then hung up on me mid-conversation and has not returned my call. That is not customer service — that is disrespect.\n\nTo make matters worse, he claimed that because my reliability was a 1, I was “probably more like a 3.7 or 3.8.” An entire point lower, based solely on his personal assumption . A difference between 3.8 and 4.8 is huge, yet he stated it as if it were fact.\nThis entire approach makes PickleLand feel less like a welcoming club and more like a gatekeeping operation built on subjective opinions. Players who have legitimately earned their rating should not have to jump through hoops or pay for unnecessary evaluations just to participate.\n\nAfter this experience, I have absolutely no interest in supporting PickleLand. I’ll continue playing at clubs that value professionalism, transparency, and player respect — places like Pickleball Kingdom and others that actually understand how to treat their members and guests.\n\nIf PickleLand wants to build a strong community, they should start by reevaluating how they handle ratings — and how their general manager communicates with players.\n\nSuch a bad experience.......",

Everyone is willing to play with you, no matter your skill level, which makes it such a comfortable place to learn and improve. We’ve already met so many new friends! We’ve also really enjoyed taking classes with Coach Bobo and Tuan -  they’re both great.\n\nOur favorite thing has been drilling. It’s helped our game so much. Being able to book courts so easily has been awesome, and the staff is always understanding and friendly. I also love that they offer 3-hour open plays and that their pricing options fit my budget.\n\nI’m really enjoying Pickle Kingdom and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get into pickleball or who’s already on their pickleball journey!",

Courts were nice and the benches and chairs were helpful for folks to take a break in between. I got caught up during the games and left my hat there and Jordan promptly found it and called me back about it. 10/10 customer service and experience, I would recommend PB Kingdom for your next event or birthday gathering, let Jared know.",

Back home (Vegas) people can use the public courts as long as they want with no requirement to give others a turn and you might wait for hours before you get an empty court. The courts at Vet's were way easier to rotate around. Don't bring a lot of stuff since you'll have to carry it on and off court every time you switch around. Way fun and chill atmosphere though. Nicely lit and courts are in good condition.",

However, Tim’s incredible patience and kindness made me feel comfortable from day one. He is a true professional who is always on time and clearly has a deep love for the game. He has a great eye for recognizing weak areas and provides clear, actionable guidance to help you improve. If you’re looking for a coach who is both expert and encouraging, Tim is the best!",

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced player, Coach Tim is able to tailor lessons to meet your individual needs, providing both constructive feedback and encouragement.\n\nWhat really sets Tim apart is his ability to break down complex skills into manageable steps. He is able to focus on improving my technique, footwork, and strategy, but also make sure that I’m having fun while learning. I’ve seen noticeable improvement in my game, and I’m now more confident on the court than ever before.\n\nCoach also creates a positive, supportive environment, which is crucial in a sport like pickleball where learning and improving can sometimes feel overwhelming. Whether you’re looking to improve your serve, develop better court awareness, or simply enjoy the game more, I highly recommend Coach Tim!",

The weight room sometimes feels quite crowded, but then other times it does not. There are a couple of leg machines missing such as leg extension and leg curl I believe. But other than that you can get a decent workout in. I love that they communicate about the courts being used for youth sports. Even before you enter the building they have a sign that says Court number one closed today, pool, etc.",

They also have programs children and youths ie sports camps etc. they offer days passes that less than 10 dollars for one day or monthly pass that are 30 for residents and 35 outside residents etc. it’s affordable for everyone. Also it really is a judgment free zone. My favorite area are the upstairs track comes handy during the hot summer when walking in the parks is to hot. The work out area with all the machines and free waits is awesome. However it would be nice if they can add stair masters also. Overall I am really pleased with my experience there.",

In early January 2023 my cardiologist was reviewing my case and he said “I want you to look like one of those ‘skinny fit’ old guys waiting to see me in my waiting room.”  I told him the only thing that ever worked for me was weight training with a personal trainer.  I had tried to find a good professional trainer in Georgetown, but the trainers I found were terrible.  He said he knew a great one that was his personal trainer.  He introduced me and he indeed was a true professional and exercise physiologist who knew the science of weight training.  I worked with him about 15 months, when he had to leave for a job in another town.  But he picked another trainer for me who he thought was excellent and I would like.  His name is Michael Schwertner and he is fantastic.  I have made excellent muscle gains with Michael.  So since starting to do weight training at Georgetown Fitness with personal trainers, I have lost about 50+ pounds and gained a lot of muscle at the same time.\n\nI highly recommend Georgetown Fitness and their team of professional trainers.\n\nI’ve attached a before and after picture to show my results.  I’ll be 77 in about 2 weeks.  Train hard, eat right, and you can get great results too.",

I've been training with Brennan for about six months - he's a terrific trainer! Constant positive attitude, always encouraging, and he knows what he's talking about.",

        "text": "A Truly Life-Changing Gym Experience – GetAgeFit\n\nMy partner and I joined GetAgeFit through their couples 2-for-1 promotion, and from the very first meeting we knew we had found something special. Theo Thurston, the owner and creator of GetAgeFit, has built more than just a gym — he’s created a community and a program that helps people improve every aspect of their lives, not just their fitness.\n\nTheo personally spent over an hour with us explaining his approach, which draws inspiration from Bill Phillips’ Body for Life program and the Time Under Tension training method. The structured 12-week program includes three weight training sessions (each lasting about 45 minutes to an hour), three cardio sessions per week, and nutritional counseling that really ties everything together. Theo’s philosophy makes it clear that nutrition, flexibility, and mindset are just as important as strength and endurance.\n\nAfter our initial meeting, Theo matched us with Will, our personal trainer, and we couldn’t have asked for a better fit. Will took the time to really understand our goals and abilities, and as we progressed, he continuously adapted our workouts to keep us challenged and motivated. Each session was focused and efficient — in under an hour we got a full, high-quality workout without ever feeling rushed or overwhelmed. Will also taught us the importance of stretching and shared simple daily routines we could do at home to support our training and overall well-being.\n\nEven after completing the 12-week program, we continued training with Will three times a week because we saw such incredible results — not just physically, but mentally and emotionally as well. Unfortunately, we eventually moved out of the area for family reasons, but we left GetAgeFit with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to continue training on our own.\n\nGetAgeFit isn’t just about lifting weights or counting calories — it’s about learning how your body works and how to keep improving as you age. Theo and his team of trainers truly care about their clients’ success and overall quality of life. We’re deeply grateful for the experience and highly recommend GetAgeFit to anyone looking to transform not just their body, but their entire approach to health and longevity.",

Our kids and ourselves have made many friends and built community through the sports program. The sports staff is super friendly and try their best to make sure all kids are having a great experience.\n\nThe facility is also always very clean and well taken care of.

The Zumba class on Monday nights is a lot of fun!! We use all the equipment in the gym and it has always been in service. Very rarely will a cardio machine be out of service and if it is it will get fixed quickly! What we like the most is that it is less than five minutes from our house in Hutto and they close at 9 during the week. The early closing helps us have a routine of a workout right after dinner. The pool is fantastic for kids and adults alike! We sometimes use the pool to swim laps! Sauna is great and spacious! About 12 people can sit in the sauna at once. If you are thinking about joining the Y, do it! They are fantastic!",

It wasn't horrible before but, the upgrades were definitely welcome.\nMy only complaint (?) is that there used to be a back entrance which is now an employees-only door. It was nice being able to park from that side since I live in east RR and come to the facility from that direction. Having a secondary entrance would allow people more parking options besides main entrance and help with foot traffic but, I am merely suggesting as it was convenient parking on that side and they may not have adequate staffing for additional entrances.\nI like the new layout and design; it feels much more planned out, spacious and designed for specific uses vs feeling a bit cramped before - it feels so fancy!",

After having a baby, he customized my workouts to help me rebuild strength safely, improve my body composition, and regain my confidence.

My trainer Haley is the sweetest (also postpartum certified for the moms out there), the front desk staff, and the kids watch people have all been great. That being said, If you’re thinking about doing personal training here, be warned: make sure you read everything and have a very clear understanding of what you’re getting into. I had a situation that has since been resolved regarding a personal training contract so just take heed.",

The front staff (not very friendly) wouldn’t honor the pass because i wasn’t “local”.  Charged me a daily rate ($15.99) and tried to charge me again because apparently it didn’t go thru!  Then asked me to stop by after my workout and check with them to make sure i paid (i dont think so, not today witches).  Equipment is nice, no towels, plenty of cardio, but typical of Crunch gyms, crowded as hell.  Hit up Golds gym down the road.",

The place is massive, packed with every machine and free-weight setup you could want, and the energy hits you the second you walk in—pure motivation.\nWhat made it unforgettable, though, was the manager, Donovan Zuniga. From day one he greeted me by name, walked me through every station, and checked in to make sure I was hitting my goals. Donovan isn’t just running a gym—he’s building a community. His hustle, positivity, and genuine care turned a good gym into a great experience.\n\nThe staff follows his lead: friendly, fast, and always ready to help. The facility stays spotless even during peak hours, and the outdoor turf area gives that extra SoCal vibe right here in Texas.\nIf you’re serious about training, do yourself a favor—join Crunch Round Rock and ask for Donovan.\n\nThank you, Crunch Round Rock, and a huge thank-you to Donovan Zuniga for making every workout feel like I’m part of something bigger. See you tomorrow!",

All of the employees have been super kind and helpful, the personal trainer that I worked with was so supportive, and helped me reach my goals. Their classes are awesome, with wonderful instructors.\n\nTheir hours are great as someone who has a very busy schedule. The gym is always clean and all of the equipment is in good condition.

It has all the amenities that make for a great escape: sauna, cold plunge, running trails, workout classes, wellness groups, etc. Many of the planned activities take place outside. (There’s nothing better than lifting weights while watching the sun set.) MOST IMPORTANTLY: the people that run Hippo Social Club are so caring and passionate about helping others into a healthy lifestyle. They foster an environment where people are encouraged to get to know each other genuinely and personally.\n\nLiving in the suburbs, I often find myself daydreaming about how much more socially fulfilled I’d be if I lived in a close-knit village instead. I think Hippo Social Club brings me as close to that daydream as physically possible. Hippo Social Club fosters a close-knit community of people passionate about health+wellness, connecting with others, and the outdoors. The best part is they’re ALWAYS open to meeting new people and I never once felt left-out or excluded as a new member. :)",

        "text": "Calvin and Scott were angels in disguise. My mother broke her hip and had hip replacement surgery. The hospital discharged her. They arranged for her to be transported by another medical transport company to a Rehab Center. The other companies drver threw her discharge paperwork at her. Then he left her suitcase on the hospital sidewalk and drove off. He was speeding and driving recklessly to the rehab center. When I arrived at the rehab center, my mother has in great pain. The rehab center was rundown. So, I decided that I would take my mother home. The rehab administrators were very helpful. They called Lone Star. As I was talking to Scott, he could hear my mother was in pain and not wanting to getback into another transport vehicle. He suggested that they use a Broda Chair transport. It's like a big lazy boy chair. His best driver, Calvin , was returning to end his shift. He said, he would ask him to make another run. Scott was concerned that we wouldn't have enough manpower to get her loaded into the chair. He decided that he would come with Calvin to help. Scott is the Executive Director of the company, no less. When they arrived, they explained to my mom; how they were going to put my mom in the Broda chair. She didn't want to change chairs because she was in so much pain. They allowed her to be in charge. If she was feeling any pain from the transfer. They would stop until she wanted to proceed. Once, she was in the chair and comfortable. Her personality changed, she was smiling, laughing and flirting with Calvin. On the ride home. Calvin would tell her about bumps in the road and curves. They had an excellent conversation. When they arrived at the house. They brought her into her room and got her into bed. My mom was in charge once again. They explained to her, how they were going to transfer her from the chair into the bed. It all went smoothly. They went above and beyond the service promised. It was a day from hell for me and my mother. But Calvin and Scott brought sunlight into a dark day; to the point of tears from me. I highly recommend this company. Its not about fitting in one more run. Its about taking care of their customers; but they treat you like family. God bless you, Calvin. God bless you, Scott.\nSincerely,\nLance Girard",

From the first moment I spoke with a receptionist (April), I was impressed with the kindness and professionalism. I was also impressed with how quickly they found room for me on their books.\n\nI was assigned Jesse for PT. He was friendly, full of great energy, but most importantly he was knowledgeable. He quickly assessed where I was in my healing process as well as ascertained additional information about my condition the doctor had not provided (no fault of his own, he smartly left the PT work to the PT!).\n\nWhile the dr had referred me for 4-6 weeks of PT, Jesse quickly unlocked a pain point that immediately changed my pain level as well as use of arm. He then gave me a few exercises to continue at home. He scheduled me for follow up two weeks out but instructed me to cancel if I found the exercises to be sufficient before the next appointment.\n\nIt’s been a week, I’ve been doing my exercises, and it’s clear that my months of stubbornness were unbelievably unnecessary. I will most likely call and cancel follow up tomorrow because of the shocking progress I’ve experienced.\n\nI’m so grateful for BSW OP and Jesse. I appreciate their drive to get patients from point A to point B in the most effective and efficient manner. I appreciate their friendliness, professionalism, and how quickly they put my concerns at ease.\n\nI would 100% recommend to a friend or family member for any physical therapy concerns!",

I started going to PT on Phase two of my Physical Therapy training at the beginning of the year after having undergone spinal cord surgery in mid November. When I started with them, I was walking at careful pace, I wasn’t bending or twisting at all. I was on a five pound lifting limit.\nBy the end of two weeks, I was not only bending, but using a 20lb ball to the floor and back repetitively. My walking pace was back to normal and my pain had gone from a 4-6 down to a 1-2. I primarily worked with Matt, who was Awesome. He pushed me and encouraged me, but never forced me, he always made sure to ask and really listen to me about how my body was feeling and responding. I worked with a couple of the other trainers, but I’m so sorry guys I can’t remember your names, but all of them were excellent. The Tech Assistant’s name is Christopher, and he was always helpful and attentive as well.\nTrust me, If you’re looking for a Physical Therapist, do yourself a favor, start your search hear and let it end here, you will be in the best of hands. You won’t regret it!",

She’s patient, knowledgeable, and truly cares about her patients’ progress.\n\nWhat really stood out is how personal and encouraging she is, she celebrates the small wins with you and pushes you just enough to keep improving without ever feeling overwhelmed. My pain has decreased so much since seeing her, and I actually look forward to my appointments now.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone who is skilled, compassionate, and genuinely invested in your healing, Karissa is the best.

Matthew, Brittany, & Karissa, all knew my Treatment Plan, and if more time was needed with another patient then another therapist would pick up the new patient without blinking. They work so well together, always positive and happy, and have taken a frightened old lady with a knee replacement who was sure she wouldn’t walk again and transformed her into someone who can walk just about anywhere!

        "text": "When I first went in to PT Solutions, my neck had severe degeneration. I could barely turn my head more than 45 deg to the right and I had constant pain. I did not have high hopes for PT since my diagnosis seemed so negative. The first day I met with Matt, one of the 3 therapists there. He did some standard strength and capability tests and we talked about my situation and previous actions I had taken, also about my lifestyle and activities. Over the next 2 1/2 months, I worked with Matt to improve strength and flexibility.  And now I have pretty much full range of motion in my neck and occasional slight pain. I have exercises to do at home to maintain this level and will likely have to do them for the rest of my life. That’s okay. They work.\n\nNow for the particulars. The facility is a fairly large open room, with equipment along the walls. They use this equipment in ways I have not seen before. For example, they have a head gear that attaches to a weight machine and I walked backwards, wearing it. We did this every visit. At first I did not like it. It hurt. But as the weeks went by and my neck got stronger and the weights were increased, I learned to appreciate it for the great improvement I felt.\n\nEach visit, when I arrived, all the employees would say hello, by my name. I liked that.  Matt would ask me about the previous few days, since my last visit. If I reported some pain from some activity, he gave me an exercise to address that specific area or movement.\n\nAs I observed the other therapists, they were all this good. As time went on, this felt more like a family, and I would look forward to my visit. I have been through much PT in my 74 years. I have to say that I found this to be the best, on all levels.",

Over the past two months, Nahyeli has helped me rehab my right shoulder after an injury, and the progress has been remarkable. She designed a variety of targeted exercises that strengthened my shoulder and got me back to doing what I love—playing pickleball!\n\nNahyeli is knowledgeable, patient, and encouraging. She explained each exercise clearly and adjusted the plan as my strength improved. Her care and expertise made every session both productive and enjoyable. I highly recommend her and the entire Baylor Scott & White rehab team to anyone needing physical therapy or injury recovery.",

I thought ok yea right I'm sure they have a mile long list and they're just saying it to be nice and keep my business.\nMonday morning rolls around and Kendra called me first thing to let me know they had a cancelation at 2pm!! I couldn't believe it.  Not only did Kendra make a great first impression impression, the PT Nahyeli is also AMAZING. She's patient, calm and kind. Very knowledgeable and really makes sure you get the most out of your visits.\nIn addition to the wonderful staff, when you call you actually get to talk to.someone at the location unlike other corporate places that have you talk to a call center. I felt like that was a nice touch.\nIf youre looking for a quiet calm PT environment with excellent staff come here!!",

I was pleased Larissa was one of two therapist who could administer dry needling which has really helped me in my progress.\nThe front staff is pleasant.

One thing that's readily apparent is that all the therapists there are passionate about their work and go above and beyond for all their clients.\n\nMy daughter's therapists, Jess, Gia, Patty and Kat, do an incredible job recognizing my daughter's needs and limitations and tailoring each of their sessions to her specifically. They make their sessions fun but also ensure she's working, too. One session my daughter was having a meltdown about bananas and Jess incorporated bananas into the entire hour-long session- they made banana art and played banana games and she came out happy and ready for her next session. As a parent of a child who struggles with transitions, I appreciate Jess' flexibility!\n\nMy daughter absolutely adores all her therapists and really enjoys coming to therapy. We have noticed a huge improvement in her emotional regulation, her behavior, her physical abilities, her stamina, and her speech! We saw my sister for Thanksgiving and she was shocked that she could understand what my daughter was saying. The therapy is incredibly effective and we're so grateful for All Care.

The facility was well maintained and the staff there are excellent - friendly and helpful-  from the front office folks to the PT techs and the PTs themselves.\nI especially enjoyed working with Dr. Trevis Green there. From the initial assessment to each of the treatment sessions, Trevis was great about listening to my feedback on whether a particular treatment was working or not. Based on that, he'll adjust the intensity or recommend other treatments.  I credit his ability to work with his patient as a team to pinpoint the issue and prescribe the right set of treatments to address the root issues. Highly recommend working with Dr. Trevis.",

Kylie guided me through rehab for both a shoulder sprain and an ankle sprain during my competitive roller derby season, ensuring I was able to compete in two tournaments despite a tight turnaround from injury. She put so much thought into curating a program that addressed the specific physical demands of my sport, and she adapted each session based on where I was that day and what my goals and timeline were moving forward.\n\nEven when I sustained a secondary ankle sprain mid-recovery, I was still able to go into tournaments feeling strong, stable, and confident thanks to her preparation. She educated me on taping techniques, warm ups, and recovery strategies. She genuinely takes the time to understand athletes and programs in a way that supports your specific performance needs, not just general recovery.\n\nIn addition, their office staff was incredibly helpful from my first phone call, walking me through insurance, explaining my coverage, and outlining costs before I even scheduled an appointment. Throughout my treatment, they made the administrative side of things a breeze.\n\nI am so grateful for the care I received and would absolutely return for any future PT needs.",

The plan is in force and will continue with a few increases which are still 50% less expensive than the plan that I was signed up for and approved.  I was misinformed and, had I not consulted directly with my insurance provider, would have made a costly mistake for 2026, solely based on the recommendation made at this location.  As an example, my current plan has a 2026 hospital deductible of $150 per day for the first 6 days.  The plan I was offered is $325 per day for first 6 days!!\n\nI thought this was an amazing experience; walked in without an appointment and just as soon as I was almost done providing my information I was able to meet with Mr. Bobby Coates, however , I was misinformed.\n\nMr Coates is professional and knowledgeable.  With a few key questions he was able to identify my medical coverage requirements and find a plan that provides coverage with my current physicians and medications., however, I was misinformed and was told my plan would end 12/31/2025.  United healthcare confirmed that it is not ending!!   Because I was already changed I had to reapply to my current plan, which I’ve had for over 5 years, and am pending acceptance.\n\nIf you have a current plan, speak directly to them for options to avoid misinformation.\n\nThank You!!",

That being said, Emily's card was given to us by a trusted friend who said \"you should call Emily, she's really good\" To say that was the an understatement, would truly be an understatement!! If Mozart played health insurance instead of piano, that's Emily. Her knowledge and understanding of the almost unimaginable health insurance nightmare is truly superhuman, and, she's so nice and understanding in finding out all the things that are your individual insurance requirements and needs, well, you just want to have her over for dinner. What i know now is, I Didn't know anything about health insurance! Emily, Jeanine and I just want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all you do for all the people like us! You truly are a health insurance Goddess! You make the world a better place! So, if you’re wondering if you should call, you should, you'll be happy (and healthier) you did!!!!!\nBig hugs to you and yours Emily, we'll never use anyone else\nThank You\nDavid and Jeanine Eby",

        "text": "My husband and I (both attorneys and used to filling out forms correctly) began the process of applying for Medicare ourselves. We used the official government website.It was a mess! My husband received a message saying that he wasn't eligible for Medicare (he is 67, born in the U.S., has worked since he was. teenager, and is very eligible) I received a different message and was told that I needed to wait for a code to be snail-mailed to me in order to continue to apply. We each called Social Security and each waited over 3 hours on hold before talking with someone, neither of whom could solve our problems. My husband was then given the an appointment for April, which is outside of the open enrollment period. Then, a friend recommended Emily Hanson. Let me begin by saying that I wish that every professional who I deal with was as good at their job as Emily is at hers. By the end of our first meeting, she had managed to get us both enrolled for basic Medicare, helped us choose the supplements we would add as soon as we received our Medicare numbers, and  helped us choose an ACA plan for our 23 year old daughter, who had been on our group plan. We couldn't believe that we had gone, in one meeting, from thinking that it would take months to untangle the problems that the Medicare website had created to having successfully completed the application process. I will recommend Emily to everyone I know who is approaching Medicare eligibility or needs other health insurance, and I am planning to ask her to evaluate and help us update our life insurance plans. I had talked with 2 other highly-recommended agents before I began the process of applying for Medicare on the government website. Neither of them help their clients through the initial application process and neither of them was nearly as knowledgeable about Medicare products and rules as Emily was. In fact, one of them gave me some incorrect advice, which could have had serious consequences. Emily, by contrast, walked us successfully through the application process, gave us very clear explanations of the different options, and gave us very clear instructions for what to expect next and told us that she would be happy to help us through the next steps. I will always use Emily for our insurance needs going forward. I only wish that I had known about her earlier!",

She is incredibly knowledgeable, extremely thorough, and highly detail-oriented. From start to finish, she guided us through every step with patience and expertise.\n\nMelissa took the time to educate us, answering every single one of our (many!) questions with kindness. Without her, I have no doubt we would have ended up with a less suitable plan that cost us more. Before meeting with Melissa, we had no idea what we were doing—but by the end, we not only fully understood our plan, but we also felt confident it was the right one for us.\n\nI can say with 100% certainty that I highly recommend Melissa Goodin for anyone needing help with Medicare, Medicare supplements, or Advantage plans in Texas. She is truly the best!",

They took the time to explain the different plans, help me choose the one that fit my needs, and answer all my questions without making me feel rushed. What stood out the most was how genuinely dedicated they were to ensuring I was covered and had all the necessary information.

        "text": "My husband and I decided to move to Texas after 22 years of military life, and buy our forever home. After many years of using the same insurance carrier we started to have some issues with the insurance company. We knew we had to look into a new Insurance carrier, but it was so scary to even think of leaving someone that we had been with for so many years. We just kept on making the large payments and dealing with what we thought was our only options. The company that we had been covered under for so many years changed their coverage structure and their customer service was on a major decline.\n\nBy chance my husband and I took our son to an outdoor event where I saw a State Farm agent table. I was like, nope. I was so agitated to even walk by there, because the only thing I knew about State Farm was the commercial and other people’s bad experiences. I just thought it was going to be daunting to even have the conversation with anyone, much less with a large known Insurance carrier. My son saw a booth that he wanted to go to and I had to walk by. Allison was so amazing! It felt like it was going to be too easy, which made me very nervous. Her spirit and personality just drew me in. She made me feel at ease about transitioning to a new company from all my insurance needs. She made all the necessary transactions. We did very little on what we thought was going to be an overwhelming task. Since then we have had to file a claim with State Farm due to a house issue. We were nervous wrecks, all the things that I have ever heard about filing a claim came to mind. We were so overwhelmed to even make the phone call. The first few steps that we took we knew that we were in great hands. The whole entire State Farm team was by our side the whole way. Phone calls, emails you name it. They were there. Their customer service is one of the best I’ve ever experienced. I know that their motto is “Like a good neighbor State Farm is there”, but it should be “like family State Farm will always be there”. Because they have always made us feel so amazing. They have given us nothing but empathy, kindness, patience, and understanding. Even when we had questions or concerns about our insurance coverage, they have been phenomenal. They have always made us feel at ease offering us  guidance when we are questioning what we need to do next. They are definitely like the calm of the storm. I know if I call for anything I am going to be smiling and feeling like I am in great hands by the time I hang\n\nI recently told one of the office team members that I wish I could call them when I’m having other problems, because they make me feel so great by the time I’m off the phone. They truly are like family. Thanks State Farm family. Allison, Kelci, Lauren, Cristina, Jessica, Sam, and Gareth we appreciate you.",

In one of my patient visits with a sweet elderly woman, I helped her make a bacon, egg, sausage sandwich and upon tasting it, she closed her eyes and did a little sweet dance swaying her hips and putting her hands in the air and said, \"this is so good, precious, I'm never letting you go!\" It was extremely fulfilling to witness that level of joy and play some part in making that happen.

My mom was transported from the hospital back to her normal facility with Traditions Hospice.  When we arrived, no equipment had been delivered.  We had to wait 4 1/2 hours for her hospital bed and oxygen to arrive.  Later at 1:30am she began to struggle to breathe and we found out that no comfort medicines had been delivered.  I was on the phone arguing with a triage nurse and finally got them to send 1 prescription to a 24 hour pharmacy.  I picked it up at 3 am.  They refused to send out a nurse immediately and told us one would be there with other medication at 8am.  By 9am I was back on the phone with them.  At that point no one had even picked up the medication.  After claims of the pharmacy being out and having to transfer the prescription to a closer pharmacy, an employee with a car broken down on the side of the road, and bad traffic, a nurse finally arrived with meds at 11:54am - 23 hours after discharge.  We have switched Hospice companies, but now are still struggling to bring her pain and struggles under control because once it is out of control, it takes a lot to bring it back under control.  I would not wish this hell on anyone.",

Yes! They told me dad had passed when he had not! Had we not decided to employ caregivers from a private pay firm, I can not imagine what other indignities would have been seen.

From the  very beginning of this journey she was compassionate, kind, caring, explained everything so that I could understand it, whether good, or not so good.  She kept on top of all the medications I needed and  communicated with the doctor if she saw a need for a change. She made me feel comfortable with the condition I was in and would go out of her way to make it more comfortable.  Now, praise God, I'm on my own but I miss her terribly.

Her oncologist recommended Compassus, but being a retired journalist I looked at several and asked a lot of questions. In the end, we chose the hospice with the most staff and the most resources and Compassus surpassed our expectations. There was one glitch with equipment but they had someone at my house within a hour to fix it. My wife died during Austin area rush hour but the hospice nurse kept us informed about her progress in getting to our house and was here in just over an hour. Through our experience we met some of the nicest, most caring people you'd ever want to meet. They met all our needs and in most cases were several steps ahead of what we needed. The pharmacy they used, Liberty on Williams, was on top of our needs as well, with daily deliveries to keep us supplied with the needed prescriptions. I am grateful to all of the people involved for providing a peaceful passing for my wife surrounded by loved ones. Plus, afterwards they got the equipment out of my house the next day and have checked in on me several times and offered grief counseling for all family members for 13 months. It's part of the service and it's all paid for by Medicare. I highly recommended Compassus and remind you that the biggest players in any industry are the most likely to draw negative reviews. Plus, many people with positive experiences do not post reviews, so I am doing it for them.",

I came here with an extremely painful issue and was understood, listened to, well cared for, was immediately made comfortable by the professionalism and knowledge of the entire staff. DrTran was spectacular and we worked at my pace. My problem was fixed, a plan for the next step organized. I have not felt so comfortable and involved in my own dental life health care plan before.

She took her time and made sure is mouth and teeth were the best that it could be.  My brother is in a nursing home and this was the first time he had his teeth looked at in years. He can't take care of himself. Thos doesn't bother Dr Tran she gets the job done!\nDr Tran got busy and continued cleaning for 2 hours! Today he is back for his 2nd mouth care with Dr Tran. She found an ulcer and recommended a specialist to evaluate it.\nDr Tran not only cleans, but at the same time inspects for possible issues. She is simply Amazing! If you are looking for a wonderful dentist- look no further!",

Bad bad bad service do not go here.\nIt took a phone call to the corporate office to get this resolved.  We were quoted double the cost of the procedure.

My husband recently went in for the same services I had done the previous year, and we were shocked to find extra charges that shouldn’t have been there. Turns out, the new billing person made some questionable decisions. Beware of the new billing practices — double check everything! Won't be coming back.\n\nIn reply to your response I called to inquire why my husband was charged $160 for a procedure that I underwent the previous year for only $50. Describing the charges as “identical” seems inaccurate, given the $110 difference in copays.\n\nWhen I requested an itemized statement, I was sent a list of procedures without any CPT (procedure) codes, which made it impossible for me to verify the charges with our insurance provider. I followed up via email to request the appropriate codes and unfortunately never received a response.\n\nAt this point, we’ve decided not to return. Thank you for your past care, but this experience has been disappointing",

I was certain they were going to find multiple cavities and suggest tons of work. To my utter shock, I still didn't have a single cavity! Gingivitis and mild gum disease, sure, but there was never anything recommended that I felt was unnecessary. A few months ago, I had a random tooth bleed after sucking on a sucker. Dr. Mattias had Dr. Heinz come to do a consult with me. After looking at it from a number of different angles and consulting previous dental records, he made the decision that I didn't need that tooth removed. Another score for them! If that wasn't all, I feel like the front desk staff are truly the best. They take time to explain things. I'm so happy to have most of my family going here! (They only take 15 & up, understandable. They aren't outfitted for pediatric dentistry, which is totally fine).",

I needed immediate oral surgery for a complicated broken tooth, and from start to finish the experience exceeded every expectation.\n\nDr. Oster performed my surgery with exceptional skill, professionalism, and care. What really sets him apart, though, is how personally invested he is in his patients—he checked on me multiple times both before and after the procedure, which made a stressful situation feel completely manageable.\n\nHe delivers top-quality care while also showing genuine support for first responders, offering fair and affordable pricing and payment options. That level of integrity and compassion is rare.\n\nDr. Oster truly goes above and beyond for his patients. He is, without question, the best dentist I have ever had. Thank you, Dr. Oster. Highly recommend.",

I am a person who was traumatized with a lot of childhood dental issues and there were no pediatric dentists in our area. It takes a lot of mental/emotional prep to go to the dentist…but, Parmer Oaks Dental Care is a game changer! I have been coming here for years and am beyond thankful for the entire staff! Dr. Oster is a very compassionate and professional dentist who genuinely cares for his patients beyond just their teeth. I appreciate such quality care and the fact that I’m truly seen and heard and my needs are validated with kindness. If you are looking for a dentist, look no further and come to Parmer Oaks Dental Care! The entire staff will welcome you with smiles, sincerity and NO JUDGEMENT! No one is more frightened of going to the dentist than me and they ALWAYS help me through every visit/procedure. Thank you Dr. Oster and the entire team!!! 🫶🏼🙌",

During my exam, I was told I had a crack in a tooth that had been filled years ago. Although I had no pain at the time, I was advised that I needed a crown. I paid approximately $900 for the crown procedure.\n\nSoon after the crown was placed, I began experiencing significant pain that lasted for weeks. When I called the office for help, I was told I needed a root canal. I paid for that treatment as well, but my condition has only gotten progressively worse.\n\nSince that time, I’ve experienced constant pain, nerve sensitivity when brushing, and an abscess along my gumline that now causes visible swelling and discomfort. I can no longer chew on that side and have been dealing with this pain for nearly six months.\n\nWhen I reached back out to the office, hoping for an evaluation and accountability, I was told I would need to pay in cash for another exam and X-ray—even though the issue began with the procedures performed there. I did receive refunds for both the crown and root canal, but I am still left in serious pain and with lasting dental damage.",

I went and got my permanent crown today and again Dr. N made me feel comfortable. Rose was right there. They truly seemed concerned that I don’t suffer any discomfort.",

So yesterday I had my extensive testing done with Dr. Long at Cook Hearing and Balance and I couldn’t be happier with my choice. She was so pleasant and knowledgeable and had a knack of explaining everything…so in two weeks or so I’ll be fitted with new hearing aids. She explained that she’ll adjust them gradually so I won’t have the huge difference I remember my mom going through. I’m actually looking forward to working with her so I can finally hear the dialog in some of my favorite British movies and shows!",

        "text": "I had my first hearing test by an audiologist in October 2011.  She encouraged me to consider hearing aids but I procrastinated. Almost 3 years later I had another audiology test in June of 2014.  A month later I went to Costco and they tested me again and sold me a pair of Resound hearing aids for $1800 with a 90-day free trial period.  I returned them a month later for a refund.  They were totally unsatisfactory.   Fast forward to April 2017and  I had another hearing test by an audiologist and my results showed a further diminishment in my hearing.  Six months later in September 2017 I went to New Sound Hearing Center in Georgetown and they tested me a quote me pairs hearing aids in the price range of $3,000 to $5,000.  I wasn't prepared to pay that much even with a free trial period.  Finally in late January 2018 I went to see James Cearnal at Georgetown Hearing Aid Center and after looking at my four previous audiology tests, he recommended a pair of Sieman's Cellion hearing aids for around $2,000.  I purchased them on a 30-free trail period and after several follow-up visits and adjustments decided to return them for a refund, which Jim processed without any hassle.  However he suggested I try another hearing aid by Hansaton and fitted me with just one hearing aid for a trial period.  If they work out he offered me to order a pair of these hearing aids for around $2,000.  I'm still in the trial period but so far so good.  I like the one hearing aid I'm testing better than any of the previous hearing aids I tried.  And communication with Jim is very easy, he listens and answers my questions.  If I end up purchasing a pair of these hearing aids Jim will service these hearing aids and make hearing adjustments as necessary.  A bonus is that his office is about a mile from my home and I can drive to his office through traffic in under 5 minutes.  I like the fact that he runs an independent Hearing Aid Center and is not part of a regional or national hearing aid chain of retailers.  And he puts everything in writing and signs it.  Accordingly I'm happy to write this review and give him a five star rating.  P.S.  He doesn't know I'm doing this and will only find out if he checks his reviews.",

I liked the chart visual and her explanations concerning each ear and also what she could do for me at my moderate level of hearing loss.  I was astonished that her product companies could color the hearing aides to blend in with my hair color!  Dr. Lim erased most of the fear I have had over the past 20 yrs after seeing how my father did not cope well with his aides for 40 yrs.  I cannot wait to visit there again in a couple of weeks.",

From the moment she greeted me with a warm smile, she was attentive, patient, and genuinely interested in what I’d been experiencing.\nShe took the time to ask detailed questions, listened without rushing, and explained everything in plain English (no confusing jargon). The hearing test was thorough, and when the results came back she walked me through the audiogram step-by-step, and explaining everything so I could understand what was going on\n\nHonestly, it was the best audiologist visit I’ve ever had.

Not only was everything explained thoroughly throughout the entire process, but the exam goes above and beyond what is checked at other hearing exam offices. Not only her hearing but also fluid, damage, buildup…everything was examined. After the exam, we were shown and verbally walked through all the results. The doctor was professional and kind to make the entire process a breeze. He was great even relating to my teenager. I would recommend getting your hearing exams done here. If you have a teen that listens to music in headphones or earbuds a lot, I would get their hearing checked here.",

At first everything seemed to be fine, but then I ended up being told by the second person that they aren’t taking new patients anymore. I will say the woman who initially answered the phone was super nice and I bet they run a good business. In the end couldn’t get it filled because of something to do with ‘DEA regulations and them not taking any patients at this time.’ They said they work with rehabs and older patients are top priority. Maybe I will try them back in the future, because they do seem nice and professional. Was kind of disappointing, as I thought I found a good new (locally owned) pharmacy to go to. Also it’s pretty close to me.\n\nTBH, I started to wonder if it was something to do with me or even my medication? Because when I first called didn’t seem to be an issue at all. (I would have thought the person answering the phone would know if they were full and not taking on any new patients.) The guy that called me back (the owner I assume) told me that. But I wish I knew the lady’s name that took the call in the first place- because she gave excellent customer service and was so friendly! 😊  The man assured me that it wasn’t me, but it was kind of odd. I would still give them a try in the future if they start accepting new patients again.",

He was very detailed in making sure that I got the right scooter for her. He went into detail about the specifics of operating the unit and was very thorough and thoughtful.\nOnly two days after the purchase my sister had an issue going down a sidewalk and Jeff actually came to the rescue to troubleshoot the issue and got her back on the road to independence. I am truly grateful for his caring heart. Thank you so much.",

After talking with Jeff the conclusion is that it was better to stay with the larger quantum powered chair he has now than some of the smaller more mobile chairs.  Reason: We would lose the very good leg and back support with the current chair.  I felt bad I did not buy anything.  The conversation about my dad’s need was excellent.\nThank You Jeff!",

He also explained that's not how they do business and reprimanded the employees responsible for my bad experience. He went out of his way to make the situation right and I definitely appreciated it. I received my refund almost immediately and assurance that the experience I had previously will never happen again.\n\nI'm extremely satisfied with that and I will definitely look to this place for any future needs.

However, several areas including the bathtubs and large portions of the flooring appeared to remain untouched or not cleaned to the level I anticipated. The sections that were completed were satisfactory, but overall the service did not meet my expectations.\n\nAfter the cleaning, the company contacted me to request approximately $200 more to “finish the job,” citing the need for additional time. As someone who has never hired a professional cleaning service before, I may have misunderstood what the standard scope of work typically includes. Still, based on the condition of the home afterward, I did not feel the results aligned with the amount charged.\n\nI work night shift and was unable to answer their phone call immediately, but all of my payment information had already been entered into their system, so there was no intention to avoid communication or payment.\n\nAdditionally, after posting my initial review, I received multiple text messages from the owner accusing me of being untruthful. I ultimately removed my first review because of this interaction and am rewriting it now with as much context as possible, including photos of the areas that concerned me.\n\nWhile some parts of the cleaning were done well, I was disappointed in both the overall quality and the professional conduct I experienced. For these reasons, I cannot personally recommend this company.",

The staff goes out of their way to ensure my home is clean and tidy.  They clean everything you ask them. The first time they did a deep cleaning was after a remodel.  They made sure to get all the construction dust and even steamed our carpets.  The staff is very diligent and treats my home like theirs. The staff seems to care I was satisfied with every room they cleaned. They made my home feel like a hotel- very tidy and presentable. They are detail oriented and very fast! Two staff cleaned my whole home in a short amount of time! They are amazing and I use them monthly.  I recommend them to anyone who cares about having a spotless home from top to bottom!",

They do a GREAT job, super reliable, always on time, and so easy to communicate with. They’ve also gone out of their way more than once to make sure the job gets done. One time, our water got cut off unexpectedly while they were in the middle of cleaning and no one was home.  Instead of stopping or leaving things unfinished, they actually went next door and kindly asked a neighbor outside to use their water so they could finish! They are awesome!",

We do keep a tidy house but we still need a deep cleaning which is what we paid for. $498.76 to be exact. An hour and a half in to a 3-4 hr cleaning and they said they were done. I went to one location and found multiple areas that needed cleaned. After the third time going back to show them that the house still wasn’t clean. Meanwhile I’m being very nice to these ladies. I even told them they have full access to the butler pantry if they wanted any snacks. The last time they came to get me to ask me to check their work, I went to one tv, wiped the top and it was still dusty, went to a mirror and did the same, went to the blind in that room and it wasn’t cleaned either, at this point they said they cleaned it three times and they were done. I am going to keep searching for a good cleaning company. The owner called and was nice about it. Turns out we keep a pretty clean house and they didn’t see any hat needed cleaned. Update. The owner called to apologize and let us know he terminated the employees that were out. We asked him to keep the staff on board, but train them properly.",

It was awesome being able to communicate with them in English.\nIn their defense, our home is long overdue for a deep clean but, things weren’t as clean as I’ve had other cleaning services leave them. We’re a relatively clean couple that have had some health issues and have fallen behind on thorough cleaning. But we have company coming and I needed a regular clean now and a deep cleaning later. They didn’t move a rolling chair or cat toys for vacuuming. I asked if they make beds, they said yes, it was oddly made. The floors needed a fair amount of touch up cleaning, especially under garbage cans, under the kitchen table, behind toilets and I rewatched my island because there were spots missed and water marks.\nI wish, if they didn’t have enough time, they would have said, “We weren’t able to really get to this or that” but it’s been disheartening noticing things and then having to really look closer.",

They’ve gained a customer for life—or at least as long as I’m living in Texas. The team was friendly, professional, and incredibly thorough. My house was spotless from top to bottom, and they paid attention to every detail—from dusting the fans to cleaning the baseboards. They didn’t just clean around things; they actually picked up items and cleaned every surface. I’ve never been so impressed or so thankful for a cleaning service. I could go on and on—highly recommend! You won’t be disappointed!",

I was introduced to Just on time cleaning ninjas through a mutual and friend and I was not disappointed. When doing the walkthrough with the leasing manager it was spotless, no cleaning fees were added to my move out. Throughout the cleaning process I was not present but Alisha kept my updated with lots of pictures. If you need a good deep clean they will 100% take care of you.",

I was blown away at how they thoroughly cleaned every nook and cranny, carefully and perfectly made beds, organized and improved the flow of my living area and kids play areas especially, managed to remove long time stains in some of our lesser used bathrooms/toilets, and finished everything off with sweet little touches like folding tissues into flowers and leaving chocolates and folding the hand towels to look elegant. They went above and beyond and I truly think this is the most clean and lovely my house has ever been.

He’s honest, loyal, and seriously hardworking. It’s hard to find someone these days who shows up, does quality work, and takes pride in what they do—but that’s Chris. I’ll definitely keep using him for future projects. Highly recommend if you want the job done right the first time.",

Had to file a BBB complaint just to get my issue addressed because they refused to accept fault.\nEdit (after response): If being a difficult customer is requesting a quote BEFORE the work was completed, than that I am guilty of. I requested a 50% discount on the service charge for you to come back out to mount the TV. The simple fact of the matter is, I asked you if you provided the mount (I was clearly skeptical because earlier in the messaged you communicated material costs were extra), the moment the techs got here they should have just said, oh ok lets quote all the work since we are here. That did not happen. You agreed to quote the work before it was completed because the only thing I was for sure that I wanted done was to mount the TV.\nYou are the most dishonest company I have ever dealt with. My reviews of your company have been nothing but honest. I never refused to pay, I wanted a discount on the service charge for repeat business. You clearly do not care about repeat business because not for 1 second did we feel like our business was even wanted. I was not difficult with the techs at all. The issue is with you and you alone. Not one time did I ever raise my voice, I clearly stated that you did not communicate the ask to the techs.",

The pricing for the \"tasks\" outlined was initially vague, but after clarifying, they eventually refunded $207 because the door itself did not have to be painted. As with most larger companies, there are fees for overhead, vehicles, insurance, etc. but their work is guaranteed for it's lifetime.

But the best thing was they were able to tell me the scope of the work and explained what was needed for my generator.  Then they said they could do it same day. Say what ?! They were very quick with the install and cleaned up afterwards. Now, I have a direct connection to my house. Both men were very well spoken and easy to talk to. I would recommend them again and again. Great job, guys!",

        "text": "We came here for the first time recently after Googling happy hours in Georgetown. 2020 Market was at the top of the list, and we were excited to give it a try. The atmosphere is vibrant, with big windows, lots of light, high ceilings, and very clever use of windmill fans as ceiling fans.\n\nSeating includes booths, tables, and stools at the bar — a nice mix — and we were happy with the selection of beers on tap and wine. We ordered the happy hour priced brisket nachos and guacamole and enjoyed our drinks while we waited for the food.\n\nThe nachos and guacamole, however, were a letdown, prioritizing presentation over eating. Both come with 5 or 6 long strips of tortilla chip, instead of a basket of traditional ones, which makes both dishes look like big flowers. Yes, it’s an inventive presentation. But when it comes to eating, it’s weird. If sharing, you have to budget your 2 1/2 chips.\n\nThere were bigger issues for the brisket nachos. I am crazy about the brisket nachos at Ivar’s in San Marcos, where every single bite of the meat on a crisp tortilla chip is smoky and delicious, so I was expecting something similar. Instead, while there was meat scattered across, it didn’t have the smoky flavor I craved. That was the main reason we ordered them, so this was a disappointment. Even more of a problem is the flower-like design, with the chips radiating out from the center. They pour runny queso and runny sour cream over the whole thing, especially in the center of the spokes, before putting some guacamole on top. This results in soggy chips and an overall mess that has to be eaten with a fork. The manager came by when we had nearly given up, asking if we needed more chips. There’s no doubt that would have helped from the beginning, when we could have treated the whole thing as a dip. But by this point, we were just done with it.\n\nThe service was fine, though I wish our server had told us we could have more chips when she brought our food. Other things on the menu look good, but I’d be careful not to order something where presentation might trump substance/flavor/texture.",

The atmosphere and vibes of the restaurant are very cute! However not every dish that we got was great. One of the things they seem to be known for are their biscuits, and I was excited to try them, but was left disappointed. They were very dry and hard. We also got the pimento cheese and crackers as a starter. It was basically cheese and crackers slapped onto a plate, with no flavor or added things to make it special. The chicken sandwich that I got was great, however! It had a super thick piece of chicken and had great flavor. I would come back to get this again, but not the other items!",

The space — a lovingly preserved corner of the 1896 Lockett Building on Georgetown’s square — is inviting, bright and airy, with a central room surrounded by a wraparound balcony.\n\nOur server greeted us warmly and brought our drinks promptly. The full bar has a nice choice of craft beers on tap, cocktails, and wine. The menu also has lots of enticing choices; so many things sounded good! We ordered the chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries and the Fried Chicken Salad (pieces of fried chicken breast on mixed greens with bits of bacon and blue cheese crumbles), and both were absolutely delicious!\n\nWe couldn’t resist the dessert special, Strawberry Buttermilk Cake with fresh berries, crème anglaise, and ice cream, and oh my goodness gracious, it was divine! We told the server it needs to be on the regular menu and she said that’s the plan.\n\nFrom the lunch crowd that was there that day, this is a very popular place, and based on our experience, it certainly merits that. We will be back again and again.",

Shanna was our server and she was manning the entire floor so I was insanely impressed with how attentive she was. She gave us great recommendations and we went with them. Holy hell we are glad we did. The food was amazing (chicken tenders are a little comically large, but I’d rather that than comically small). Dipping sauces were SO good and yes, we ordered pretty much every sauce available. Shanna was also delightfully funny and kind. We had a great time today.",

I would have popped it out of the grease a couple of minutes sooner. But the chicken is hand cut because the pieces are huge. The biscuits were very dry. I ate mine anyway because it's still a biscuit! Coleslaw was good and I liked the kale. It was very clean, quiet and relaxing.",

We got our usual chicken and waffles, tenders for the kids, well when i tell you the quality was worse than fast food, they looked and tasted just like those frozen already cooked pieces of chicken, same with the waffles. They used to make the fried chicken there, im not sure why they changed it, as you can see in the picture thats not made from scratch, literally frozen chicken tenders, we paid almost $90 for horrible food that we didnt finish, even the coffee was cold. I emailed the contact on the website and have not received any response. Such a disappointing visit!",

Similar to what you would get on hot wings. I really like the layout of the restaurant and it was nice and clean with a really cool design.

The atmosphere and layout are fantastic, and even though we didn't have a reservation, we were seated quickly,.\n\nThe menu is definitely centered around chicken dishes, and everyone in our party had something different, from chicken sandwiches to chicken tenders. We started with the Honey Sriracha brussel sprouts, and they absolutely did not disappoint. For my main, I went with the Honey Sriracha chicken sandwich. The flavor was really good and it wasn't too spicy, but it was a little messy and mushy from the sauce. Despite that, the flavor was great, and it was a huge sandwich!\n\nThe absolute highlight of our visit, though, had to be our server, Alison. She was so nice and personable, and she took the time to walk us through the menu and give us some great recommendations. She made us feel right at home and did an excellent job taking care of us.\n\nOverall, Goodfolks is a great place, and with service like Alison's, we'll definitely be back.",

From the start, the experience was smooth and enjoyable. The service was great, and our server was attentive throughout the meal and even offered helpful recommendations.\n\nThe drinks were also a highlight. I ordered a bourbon-forward cocktail, and it paired really well with my meal. For food, I went with the grilled cheese sandwich, and it was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly cooked, rich, and comforting. I also had the tomato bisque, which was equally impressive—warm, flavorful, and the perfect complement to the sandwich.\n\nMy friend ordered the four-piece chicken tender meal and loved it. He paired it with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts, both of which were really good. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food, and there were no complaints across the board.\n\nOverall, it was a great lunch experience with good food, solid drinks, and excellent service. I’ll definitely be coming back.",

Oh, and the food is consistently great. We are stuck on the meatball and polenta appetizer and pizzas but have enjoyed many dishes and always go back. Not great for kids, but not bad, good for date night. Creative but classic cocktails and scrumptious desserts.   The noise level is just right for semi-intimate conversation and bigger parties can all hear each other.\n\nIf I could change one thing it would be add an eggplant dish but so many good eats keeps us coming back.\n\nSee ya again soon, La Riv.",

We ordered the Carne pizza and Spaghetti Carbonara—both were outstanding. The pasta was rich and flavorful, and the pizza crust was perfectly crisp and delicious. It was hard to choose between dishes, but next time I’ll definitely be trying the Shrimp Scampi! Highly recommend this spot for anyone who loves authentic Italian food.",

        "text": "As we continue trying different restaurants in downtown Georgetown, we made reservations at La River Wood Italian Restaurant. After about a 15-minute wait, we were seated near the front door. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the staff overall seemed pleasant.\n\nOur server was Paul. While looking over the menu, it felt like the restaurant catered more toward wine enthusiasts, as the wine selection seemed more extensive than the food selection. Having traveled to Italy and visited many Italian restaurants across the U.S., I expected more traditional Italian options. I was also surprised they didn’t have lasagna, and when I mentioned it, I was told it was more of an Americanized dish than Italian—which I personally disagree with.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Italian meatballs and spaghetti, but unfortunately it was very bland and under-seasoned. Normally I finish everything on my plate, but this time I couldn’t. My wife ordered the fish, and she felt the same way—it also lacked seasoning. Both dishes were presented well, but no one offered parmesan cheese, seasoning, or anything extra to enhance the flavor.\n\nService was decent overall, but the biggest issue was the long wait for our food—over 45 minutes. After checking with Paul, we were told the fish takes a long time, but that hasn’t been my experience. I later spoke with the manager, who was very professional and checked on the delay. He discovered our order hadn’t been entered in a timely manner and offered to comp our meal, which we appreciated. He also brought out extra meatballs while we waited—though they were also bland—and we were given a slice of red velvet cake, which was okay.\n\nBased on this experience, we’re willing to give the restaurant another try in the future—possibly with different friends to get a second opinion—especially since it was clearly busy and popular. People must enjoy it for a reason, though from our visit, the food selection and flavor didn’t seem to be the main draw.",

There is a nice indoor seating area and menu features a nice selection of home-cooked, traditional Texas and Tex-Mex dishes.\n\nHad an early lunch here recently, found the Chicken fried chicken lunch to be very good. Chicken was nicely crispy fried yet still succulent and flavourful. Mash and gravy tasted perfect, as did the grilled vegetables.

We arrived when they opened and had a great dinner!  Our waiter was Dave!  Thank you sir!  Excellent job!  By 5:30pm it was getting pretty loud…. We talked to some locals who said the owners are limited by mods they can make “historical building” stuff, cannot fix the sound issue.  Suggest lowering the volume of the music, let the banter be the noise!\n\nWe sampled across the menu… crab cake was delicious, one of the best we’ve had in a while.  Ceviche and ahi poke tacos were super fresh, all made to order, great taste!  The sake sea bass was awesome, cannot go wrong there!  The gumbo was good, but needed a bit more depth of flavor (more spices)… plenty of seafood in the and the andouille was great!\n\nCool place, nice vibe… the noise issue could be better, but improvements likely limited by building codes.  Dine early and often!  Highly recommend Georgie’s!",

I parked on Myrtle rd few blocks from the restaurant. Second, on Sunday it closes by 2pm, so be prepared to reserve and get there early.\n\nThe restaurant is set in a gorgeous building and they have maintained the history of the place. The food is great, I loved it. I had the eggs Benedict with tenderloin and the eggs were just perfect. Paired with roasted potatoes, I had my fill of carbs for the day. The cocktails were the highlight - in transit and Georgetown sunrise - I’d recommend both :)\nTopped off the meal with Affogato and that was the icing on the cake for such a great meal. It’s a bit towards the pricey end but enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.\n\nThe service was great as well. Overall nice place to go for lunch!",

She was amazing, and was a treat to have as our waitress/server. The Speakeasy’s atmosphere was also awesome!

        "text": "I rarely leave negative reviews, but our experience at City Post in downtown Georgetown was so bad that it deserves an honest account.\n\nWe were dining with family and genuinely looking forward to a great evening. Given the prices and the way City Post presents itself, we expected a polished, high-end experience comparable to similar establishments. That expectation was completely unmet.\n\nThe service was absolutely terrible from the start. Our server, Heidi B, was extremely snarky and rude which is unacceptable at any restaurant—especially one charging premium prices. When we asked to speak with a manager, things somehow got worse. The manager, Jenna, was dismissive and unprofessional, and her attitude made it clear she had no customer service skills. She should not be managing a restaurant that advertises itself as upscale, or any restaurant to be honest.\n\nThe food was just as disappointing.  My sea bass was so overly salted. My daughter’s sea bass was the opposite problem—dry, overcooked, and equally inedible. The side of green beans was undercooked, under-seasoned, and frankly not worth serving at all.\n\nFor the price point, this experience was shocking. Poor service, rude management, and food that couldn’t be eaten is not what anyone expects when choosing a restaurant like City Post. This was not just a bad night—it was a complete failure across service, management, and kitchen. We will not be returning, and I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quality dining experience.",

Formerly the post office of Georgetown, with notes of such throughout the lobby and the dining rooms. Very upscale seating and atmosphere, quality customer service as soon as you walk in the door. We came in for brunch and got seats at the bar quickly, I would recommend reservations. We enjoyed a Mimosa and an iced coffee, the chefs designed an iced latte was incredible. After perusing the menu we thought to split the City Breakfast with the Corned Beef and Hash. We were not disappointed. The sauce on the biscuit is so clever, sort of a gravy/hollandaise mix with just the right amount of kick; and it goes good on everything. They have a great cocktail menu with something for everyone, including \"Prohibition Style\" drinks and even local beers on tap. The restrooms are an example of the sense of detail from this venue, they think of everything and excel everywhere. During our visit we were appraised of their Friday and Saturday speakeasy, the golden peacock, in the basement. We are looking forward to our next visit.",

        "text": "My wife and I looked forward to our reservation at City Post. We like trying new places and this looked promising.\n\nFirst, the good: The aura is great, and it felt upscale without being stuffy. We loved the little touches like the stamp on the ice cube in my old fashioned. Also, we added grilled shrimp to my entree, and I appreciated they removed the entire shell so that no meat was inside and only actual tail fins were attached. The service was also terrific. My wife's lobster roll was really good as was my dry aged rib eye.\n\nThe less than stellar: the fries with the lobster roll were all but inedible; not crisp, not very flavorful and almost seemed like an after thought. The lobster mac and cheese was ok, but we expected it to be really good given the nature of City Post. We like eating at restaurants that make better food than we do and those two sides just weren't up to that standard. We felt that fries should be a bumpset for skilled chefs and the mac and cheese should also be an easy score. So, for that reason, I rated the food lower. One last thing - my steak knife was about as sharp as a plastic butter knife. I get that I don't need razor blade sharpness, but I had to do quite a bit of sawing just to cut my steak.\n\nWith that said, we enjoyed our time. We had the perfect table and except for the sides, this would've been an easy 5 stars.",

It’s important to pair it with the lobster mac n cheese because that dish is amazing.\nThe staff was nice and friendly.

They look delicious but I can't ever seem to not order breakfast here.\nWe usually take a cinnamon roll with us for dessert later. They are so cinnamony ( I know that's not a real word).\nMake sure you check the board next to the hostess on the way in for specials of the day.\nPlenty of parking in the lot next door but street construction makes it a little challenging to reach the restaurant.\nDefinitely worth the trip for breakfast or lunch.

The staff is friendly and welcoming, which makes the whole experience even better. I also love that the parking is easy and convenient — a big plus when you’re in a hurry or visiting with family. Definitely a place I’ll keep coming back to!",

The chicken and dumplings were very good. I would've liked a few more dumplings but I'm a dumplings fan and the more the better. Several of our party ordered it and were pleased as well, also looking for more dumplings (we were all dumpling fans-haha). The meatloaf was very good. Nice size piece cut into thirds. Juicy and tender. Creamed corn was nice and sweet. Never saw onions on loaded mashed potatoes before, not a fan. Old style green beans-yum. Chicken fried steak was a nice size and crispy but a little too salty. Probably wont order that again. Side salads are huge! Kudos on that!! Liver and onions was also ordered but i havent heard the feedback on that yet. The pork chops were a huge hit. Tender but juicy. Definitely will come back to try breakfast.",

We had to return the mushrooms because they were not fully cooked. They were just returned to our table still uncooked, they took the batch that we were given, that we touched and the waiter touched and put it back in the fryer and reserved them STILL under cooked. How?! I'm so confused. Dinner was CFS for both of us, with mac & cheese (not good either). After arriving with hope of this being a great new place for date nights, we left disappointed and let down. 🙈",

        "text": "We stopped at Simmer Down Café in Georgetown on a Tuesday for lunch.  Thank goodness for Google maps, because I would have totally missed this place.  This is not in a traditional strip mall and parking can be a challenge.  To get a parking spot, we had to go several buildings away and we were worried that we parked someplace we shouldn’t.  If you go during a busy time, be prepared for a search to find a spot to park!\n\nI saw some criticism in other reviews about slow service, and we experienced the same thing.  It was during the busy lunch hour, but, wow, the service was very slow.  Our server eventually stopped at our table and apologized for the slowness.  This is clearly a staffing issue.  The servers were hustling to serve customers and also bus the tables after people left and to seat new customers.  If you can’t get a timely lunch meal out, then you need more cooks.  From talking with our server, the management knows all this and is working to hire more people.  I hope they get it fixed soon, because despite the parking headache and the very slow service, the food was great.\n\nWe got the Chicken Fried Steak and the Rueben sandwich.  My wife got mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese with her CFS.  She originally wanted creamed corn, but it wasn’t available.  You can clearly tell that the CFS and mashed potatoes are made from scratch in house.  It was a thick piece of meat with the perfect level of breading.  We both liked the mashed potatoes and white gravy.  The mac & cheese was in a white cheese sauce, and I liked it more than my wife.  The Rueben was also very good.  I would have liked more meat on the sandwich (especially for an $18 sandwich), but it was well put together and tasted great.  I got the fries with my Rueben and my wife and I finished them off fairly quickly!\n\nI recommend that you go to Simmer Down Café and give them a try.  Be ready to deal with the valid negative criticisms and just go try it for yourself because the food is worth it.  They won’t fix the parking problems, but I have high hopes that they will get the staffing fixed.  Oh, one last criticism.  The system that they use for paying your bill at the table is terrible.  You can’t really review your bill before you are handed a small device with even smaller buttons to put in the tip and pay with your credit card.  My wife pushed the second tip option, which turned out to be 25%.  That’s fine, but she was just guessing when she picked.  Come on, this can be made so much easier!  Get a new better system!  Also, a pet peeve, they add a 3% fee for using a credit card.  We didn’t know this until we asked for a printout of our paid bill.  Credit card fees are a cost of doing business and should be absorbed in the prices.  I’m sure there will be people that disagree, but it’s just my opinion.",

Decor is nice, the server was very friendly and accommodating but the food took longer to arrive than it should have. Unfortunately, the food was bland and uninspiring. Pancakes were decent, biscuit/gravy were as expected, but everything else was bland. I had two main issues as to why I won't be returning. One was charging me a credit card fee. This is a cost of doing business plain and simple, especially now that we are a cashless society. There isn't an electricity fee, or a water fee, that would be ridiculous so why add some other random overhead charge. Second, the bland breakfast for two with tip and fees was $54. That is just way too much for what we got.",

On this occasion, I ordered the Big Dipper: sliced top sirloin, caramelized onions, provolone cheese on a baguette with steamy au jus, with onion rings.\n__________________________________\nThe sandwich: the meat was so overly cooked, it was tough to eat, burned, and even crunchy in spots. You truly had to rip it with your teeth just to manage a small bite, and they forgot to put on the cheese. It was just beyond dry-even with the au jus- and overly done, making it unappetizing. I cannot recommend it from my experience. The price doesn't justify what you receive.\n\nThe Onion Rings: They were OK. Much better than the sandwich.\n___________________________________\nService: They offered phenomenal customer service, we were seated promptly, and there was not a long wait for our entrées.\n___________________________________\nAtmosphere: Beautiful restaurant and great ambiance.\n__________________________________\nPrior visit: I ordered the Texas Sized Pastrami Reuben and encountered the same problem: the sandwich was overly done,  not prepared well, and unappetizing.\n\nI haven't had any luck with their sandwiches and the onion rings are just OK.\n__________________________________\nI'm not entirely sure I'll attempt a third visit, but as they say, \"The third time is the charm.\"\n\nIf you go, avoid the sandwiches, or don't have high hopes in that department.",

We started with the Maple Glazed Crackling Pork Belly then shared the Veal Loin Chop Piccata and Flame Kissed Agave Chicken Breast. We both are huge chicken piccata fans, their veal picatta was to die for! Perfectly cooked and the sides were better than described on the menu. The chicken was cooked beautifully but a little on the sweet side, which we weren't upset with considering agave was used in the description. First time but definitely not the last dining experience here! Thanks Brent for making our experience memorable and we hope to see you again soon :)",

Topped with a bit of cabbage and cilantro, very yummy.  The chicken and dumplings is traditional with pillowy, tender dumplings covered in a white, very creamy sauce. Be sure and ordered some rolls to help get every last bit of sauce and chicken from the bottom of the bowl.  Another hearty option is the beef pot roast.  Fork tender with a bit of smoke sitting in a heaping helping of mashed potatoes.  Too much for one person!",

We may or may not have snagged the brand name and already have it en route to our house.\nThe frittata Lorraine was fluffy and divine.

The cinnamon roll was so good it had me questioning if I’d ever tasted a cinnamon roll so good.\n\nIt took 3-4 minutes before anyone acknowledged me, but outside of that the visit was pleasant and worth the drive. The price was reasonable and I look forward to coming back to try more items on the menu.\n\nThe location was easy to find, parking was also readily available.

I tried to make a reservation for lunch on a Saturday a week in advance and noticed that they only take reservations after 3 pm each day. I thought this was a little odd but hoped for the best. We arrived at 11:30 and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We walked around a bit and were called back within 15 minutes, which was a nice surprise. The host hadn't asked if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating. We would have preferred indoor but were sat outdoor. The first thing we were told by our waitress was that they were completely out of cinnamon rolls. Bummer since that's the thing they are known for and what I was looking forward to! I do understand running out, but if it's your most popular item, you should definitely plan for more and then can do more business! 3 people at our table ordered French toast, and it wasn't until after the third person ordered that she also informed us they were out of that. They were also out of most scones. That's a lot of things to be out of by lunchtime on the weekend. I guess it was really busy, we never once had our waters refilled the entire time we were there, so most of us sat without any the whole meal. She didn't come back for long stretches of time and we actually had to go find her to pay since we sat there and were ready to go for 15 minutes after finishing. I think being a little more attentive would really go a long way. Half of our to-go order was missing but the party was ready to leave at this point. This is a really cute place and I hope they can work on making more food portions correct so we all can enjoy what the menu offers!",

Service was straight up BAD! Food was 🤨\n\nFIRST VISIT;\nI can't begin to tell you how awesome this place is!  Literally everything was in point!! So between all of us we tried the catfish plate,  the sweet and spicy chicken sandwich with onion rings, Cajun craw fish, and some plain craw fish and some peach cobbler!  Dayum! Everything cooked to perfection. Chicken was so good and as i continued to eat it it got spicier and just good.  Omg! The onion rings were heavenly!  So so good!  The catfish good the queso and salsa so good and the crawfish were so reasonable in price definitely made a huge impression.  The service was outstanding and just a great environment!  Our new go to spot! Come see for yourself!!!",

We mentioned it was our first time visiting and I asked the order taker a few questions about their different tacos. He told me his opinion and why he liked one vs the other. I decided to go with his suggestion and ordered the Chipolte Shrimp tacos, blackened with their street corn and coleslaw.\nMy husband got a burger and gumbo. He said his burger was good but the gumbo didn’t have much flavor.\nMy tacos were full of flavor with the chipotle sauce, not too spicy considering the shrimp were blackened- which is what I was hoping for. I’m not much of a spicy food person! Their street corn was also extremely good, a little spicy for me but I couldn’t stop eating it! The coleslaw was different in a good way. It wasn’t big and chunky, not too vinegary or too much mayonnaise.\nThe place is decorated nicely and the staff very friendly and informative. Our server was very attentive, checking on us several times during our meal.\nWe had a great experience and will be waiting patiently for the new location to open in Leander - it’s “proposed” as of this review.",

One of the things that we enjoy the most by far is the food but not only that is the servers that they have including one in particular that we've had on several different occasions that goes by the name Cameron. Cameron has waited on us a few times now, and she’s always a breath of fresh air. She’s upbeat without being over the top, and she keeps things running smoothly even when the place is busy. Our food comes out just right, she checks in at good moments, and she makes the whole visit feel easy. She’s one of those servers you’re happy to see when you walk in. Always makes it an enjoyable visit! You have a good work!",

Once we found a seat we were almost immediately greeted by a server who let us know he would be taking care of our order. Food came out quickly and our server checked in a couple times to make sure we were satisfied. It is a scratch kitchen and our food was delicious. Would recommend looking at menu online prior to arriving if you want more time to review the menu. They have a good size menu with lots of options and we felt a bit overwhelmed trying to decide while standing at the counter.Casual atmosphere. We sat inside but they also have a nice patio area for outdoor seating.",

And they do a fabulous expanded menu for dinner.\nAll kidding aside I highly recommend this place\n\nDinner was great! The lasagne was as promised - huge",

If you’re not up for a sandwich, then the lunch menu is anemic. The dinner menu is more weighted to pizza and pasta. Just wish the lunch menu offered more than hot dogs, sandwiches and spaghetti. Where’s the deep dish? Where’s the  muffuletta?  Calzone? Pizza- there are literally 5 places with awesome thin crust pizzas on the square. Bring the deep dish.  Nobody has the deep dish except via 313. Anyway. A for effort. C- for creativity. Secret: we’re looking for things nobody else offers.",

I had the creamy chicken pesto was was absolutely wonderful.

Tucked away in Georgetown, this cozy little Italian spot was quiet on a Tuesday evening but delivered big on flavor and service.\n\nWe started with the fried mozzarella sticks, which were absolute perfection—crispy on the outside, gooey (but not runny) on the inside, with that glorious mile-long cheese pull you dream about.\n\nFor mains, our table had a variety: classic cheese ravioli in marinara, rich fettuccine Alfredo, a fresh and generous Caesar salad, and my dish—a chef’s choice that completely blew me away. Penne in creamy Alfredo, topped with a perfectly breaded chicken breast, all finished with sautéed peppers and jalapeños that gave the dish a flavorful kick without overpowering it. It was honestly the best Italian food I’ve had since my last trip to New York.\n\nThe service was top notch—friendly, engaged, and attentive without hovering. It felt like dining with people who genuinely cared about your experience.\n\nThe Red Door is a hidden gem just waiting to be discovered. I’d give them a bonus star if I could—for the food, the warmth, and the pleasant surprise. We’ll absolutely be back.",
